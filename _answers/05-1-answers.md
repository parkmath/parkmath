|1|Birmingham, Cottondale, <br>Tuscaloosa, Huntsville, <br>for a total of 202 miles.|
|2|You can do it with three colors.|
|3b|Yes, it’s possible.|
|4|Three colors|
|6|Three blocks|
|11 a|Three|
|11 b|Five|
|11 c|Iraq|
|12|Four tanks.|
|13 a|Isomorphic|
|13 b|Not isomorphic|
|13 c|Isomorphic|
|13 d|Isomorphic|
|14 a|Yes|
|14 b|No|
|14 c|Yes|
|15 a|A1, B4, C1, D2|
|15 b|A3, B2, C2, D3, E2, F4, G2|
|15 c|A2, B4, C1, D1, E2, F2, G4, H2|
|15 d|A5, B3, C3, D3|
|16 a|Planar|
|16 b|Planar|
|16 c|Not planar|
|16 d|Not planar|
|16 e|Not planar|
|16 f|Planar|
|17|No|
|18|Two times|
|19|If you’re having trouble with this one, think about exactly what is going wrong as you construct your graphs.|
|21 a|See 16c for a picture.|
|22 a|10|
|22 b|15|
|22 c|3|
|23 a|The number of edges is 4950.|
|23 b|The real answer is to generalize your method in the previous problem. But check to see if the expression <span>$\frac{{n(n - 1)}}{2}$</span> gives you the right number of edges.|
|24 a|No|
|24 b|It goes up faster than linearly. By the way, if <span>$f(n) = \frac{{n(n - 1)}}{2}$</span> isn’t a linear function, what type of function is it?|
|25|46 nodes|
|26|125,000|
|27 a|Yes|
|27 b|No|
|27 c|No|
|28|It takes nodes as input, and returns positive integers as output.|
|29|It’s planar.|
|30|Yes|
|31|2572 miles|
|32 a|Represent the pages as nodes. Two nodes are connected by a (directed) edge if the page represented by one node has a link to the page represented by the other.|
|32 b|3 clicks to get from TS to TS3, <br>4 to get from TS3 to Buzz Lightyear.|
|33 a|As a hint, you can use a “start” node, then use nodes to <br>represent the completion of each task, with the edge to that node labeled wtih the time it takes to complete the task. It takes 120 minutes to complete all the tasks.|
|33 b|You can do it with yourself plus two elves, especially if the elf who starts the dishwasher then loads the dryer while you’re getting started washing your lights.|
|34 a|16 moves (did you think about how to draw a graph?)|
|34 b|8 moves|
|36 a|Yes|
|36 b|No|
|36 c|No|
|36d|Yes|
|38|Complete graphs with an odd number of nodes.|
|42 a|<span>${(x + 4)^2}$</span>|
|42 b|<span>$(x + 4)(x - 4)$</span>|
|42 c|<span>$x = 2{\text{ or }}3$</span>|
|42 d|<span>$3\frac{1}{{15}}$</span>|
|42 e|9|
|44|It was $K_{3,3}$.|
|45|Two; two|
|46|<span>${\text{total degree }} = 2mn$</span>|
|47|<span>$\frac{1}{9}$</span>; <span>$\frac{1}{{mn}}$</span>|
|48 a|Yes|
|48 b|Yes|
|48 c|No|
|48 d|Yes|
|48 e|Yes|
|49 a|4 moves|
|49 b|16|
|49 c|<span>$12n - 8$</span>|
|49 d|<span>$3n - 2$</span>|
|50|Yes|
|51|No|
|52 a|No|
|52 b|Yes|
|52 c|Yes|
|52 d|Yes|
|52 e|Yes|
|52 f|No|
|52 g|No|
|53|Yes|
|54|It does matter which node you start with. Consider odd/even degree again.|
|55|The basic insight is the same as required for the Euler circuit on a non-directed graph. Be precise in your description of what’s necessary.|
|56|Note that “path” here is being used in the same sense as it is in “Euler path”: you need to visit all the nodes, but don’t need to end where you began. In that case, yes, every tournament has a Hamiltonian path. If there is more than one path, then using the graph will not help you rank the teams.|
|58|9|
|59|Use the nodes to represent “decision points,” and edges as the path from one decision point to another.|
|60|Yes|
|61|Yes|
