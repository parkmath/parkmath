|4 a|If Zardon’s wife finds him attractive, then he didn’t eat sardines for lunch.|
|4 b|Nothing can be concluded—the converse is not necessarily true.|

|4 d|He ate sardines for lunch.|
|5|If the diagonals bisect each other, then <span>$DE = EB$</span> and <span>$AE = EC$</span>. By vertical angles, <span>$\angle AED = \angle CEB$</span>, and <span>$\angle AEB = \angle CED$</span>. So, by S.A.S Congruence, <img class="image" width="86" height="20" src="10-2_Answers_8-19-11-PRINT-web-images/Geometry%20answer%20to%20S%26amp_R%207.ai" alt="Geometry%20answer%20to%20S%26amp_R%205%20fifth%20eqn.ai">and also <img class="image" width="83" height="20" src="10-2_Answers_8-19-11-PRINT-web-images/Geometry%20answer%20to%20S%26amp_R%208.ai" alt="Geometry%20answer%20to%20S%26amp_R%205%20sixth%20eqn.ai">. Since Clones have identical <br>body parts, <span>$\angle EAB = \angle ECD$</span> and <span>$\angle DAE = \angle BCE$</span>. But this means that AB is parallel to DC, because if alternate interior angles are congruent, the lines are parallel. For the same reason, AD must be <br>parallel to BC, and so ABCD has been proven to be a <br>parallelogram.|
|6|Angle FGH = Angle IHG because FG and HI are parallel and where GH is the transversal. So triangle FGH and triangle IHG are congruent by ASA. So FH=IG by CPCTC.|

|12|The basis of this problem is to realize that since the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles, it therefore MUST be GREATER than either one of the individual remote interior angles. So for parts a and b, an exterior angle is greater than a remote interior angle, but in turn that remote interior angle is in fact also an exterior angle to another triangle, so it is greater than that other triangle’s remote interior angles, and so on…|

|20 b|It’s a rhombus.|
|20 c|Yes, because the each transversal will generate two angles that must add up to 180 degrees.|

|22|It doesn’t have to be anything special. You can draw pictures of quadrilaterals that fit this condition that don’t fit any <br>special category.|
|23|There are many possible <br>answers. Here are some <br>possibilities. a)A pair of opposite sides is parallel. A pair of opposite sides is congruent. b)All angles equal 90 degrees. All sides are congruent. c)A pair of opposite sides is parallel and congruent.|
|24|96|

|26 a|Since DF=EF, angle EDF and angle FED are equal. This means that angle CDF and CEF are equal. And this means that angle FDA and angle FEB are equal, since when added to angle CDF and angle CEF they add up to 180 degrees. Angles DFA and EFB are equal by vertical angles. Thus, triangle AFD and triangle BFE are congruent by A.S.A. So AF=FB by CPCTC. This means that triangle AFB is isosceles.|
|26 b|-----|
|27|The key to this problem is to understand that quadrilateral AEDB may not be a parallelogram; ED may be longer or shorter than AB, and BD need not be parallel to AE.|

|31|DF= 5.2, AD= 8.3, angle ADC = 40 degrees, angle BAD and BCD are 90 degrees, arc BC = 40 degrees, angle CBF = 50 degrees, angle CFB = 40 degrees, angle BFD is 140 degrees, chords AB and BC are 3.79 (part of right triangles), arc AD is 140 degrees, arc DE is 40 degrees, arc CE is 100 degrees.|
|32 a|No. Opposite angles must <br>add up to 180 degrees in an inscribed quadrilateral.|
|32 b|Yes. Radii are equal, as are the external tangents.|
|32 c|Yes. Angle NIL must equal angle ONI, as they are inscribed in equal arcs. But they are alternate interior angles to transversal NI, so LI is parallel to ON.|
|32 d|Possibly. Draw a random kite; are both pairs of opposite angles congruent?|
|32 e|Possibly. Only if the <br>parallelogram is a rhombus.|
|32 f|Yes. Opposite angles in an inscribed quadrilateral add up to 180 degrees (Can you prove this fact? You should be able to!), so angle SNA and angle SKA add up to 180. But angle SKA and angle EKA add up to 180 as well. So SNA and EKA <br>must be equal.|
