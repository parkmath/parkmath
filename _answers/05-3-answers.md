|2|You can find out their number by subtracting 5.|
|3 a|<span>$x + 8$</span>|
|3 b|<span>$3(x + 8) = 3x + 24$</span>|
|3 c|<span>$3x + 13$</span>|
|3 d|<span>$6x + 30$</span>|
|3 e|<span>$x + 5$</span>|
|3 f|Subtract 5.|
|4|You should get your original number back.|
|5|You should get your original number back.|
|6 f|You get Crocker|
|6 g|You get Betty|
|6 h|Call the numbers $B$ and $C$ and follow the algebra through.|
|7 a|The complicated expression you should get is <span>$\frac{{{{(x + 4)}^2} - 16}}{x} - x$</span>.|
|7 b|Multiply it out; it is <span>${x^2} + 8x + 16$</span>|
|7 c|<span>$\frac{{x(x + 8)}}{x}$</span>|
|7 d|<span>$x + 8$</span>|
|7 e|Subtracting 8 from <span>$(x + 8)$</span> (what you are asked to do in the final step of the trick) results in x, your original number. Have fun making up the trick.|

|27|Hint: Write the odd numbers as <span>$2m + 1$</span> and <span>$2n + 1$</span>.|
|28|Write out the process using algebra. 72 is divisible by 6, <br>but 9 is not divisible by 6.|

|31|-1;1|

|35|You should wind up with your age before the decimal point and your number of pennies after.|
|36|They could take the square root.|
|37|You wind up with the second number.|
|38 a|Yes.|
|38 b|Calculate <span>$(x + y)(x - y)$</span>.|
|38 c|Multiply out <span>$(x + y)(x - y)$</span>.|
|38 d|9984 (Think of as the sum of 100 and 4 times their difference.)|
|38 e|The middle term disappears… these all illustrate the pattern <span>$(a + b)(a - b) = {a^2} - {b^2}$</span>.|
|39 a|Hint: once you’ve written down what happens to a number $x$, factor that expression.|
|39 b|Jake assumes that the quantity <span>$50 - x$</span> will be positive, but if <span>$x = 99$</span> this won’t be the case.|
|40 a|He’s right – call the two numbers $a$ and $b$ and check it out.|
|40 b|It’s probably not always quicker. Phil chose well using numbers that added up to 60, which ends in a zero and is easy to square in your head.|
|41 a|<span>$.3674 = \frac{{3674}}{{10000}}$</span>and <span>$.1864597 = \frac{{1864597}}{{10000000}}$</span>. <br>Note that the fractions are not necessarily in lowest terms.|
|41 b|<span>$\frac{{862862}}{{1000000}}$</span>, for instance.|
|41 c|Yes.|
|41 d|-----|
|41 e|-----|
|42 a|<span>$(x + 3)(x - 4)$</span>|
|42 b|<span>$x = - 2 \pm \sqrt 2 $</span>|
|42 c|<span>$\frac{{20}}{3}$</span>|
|42 d|<span>$5{a^2}b\sqrt {2b} $</span>|
|42 e|45|
|43|You’ll get your number back again.|
|44|Yes. To prove it, remember that you can write a number that is divisible by 3 as <span>$3k$</span>, for some integer <span>$k$</span>.|
|45|Yes.|
|46 a|<span>$100A + 10B + C$</span>|
|46 b|Yes.|
|46 c|-----|
|46 d|<span>$ABC$</span> must be divisible by 3.|
|46 e|<span>$ABC$</span> cannot be divisible by 3.|
|47|----|
|48|The number you get after the subtraction will always be divisible by nine (by the result in the previous problem). Since Fido knows, therefore, that the sum of the digits of this number should be nine, he can figure out which one you circled and didn’t include.|
|49|Notice how the different corners of the diagram represent how many 1s, how many 10s, how many 100s, etc. The method will not always work without modification – try it with numbers containing digits greater than just 1, 2, or 3.|
|50|<span>${(a + b)^2} = {a^2} + 2ab + {b^2}$</span>|
|51|Hint: imagine removing the box in the lower right corner (how do you indicate “removing” in mathematical notation?) and rotating the box in the upper right corner 90 degrees, sliding it down below the diagram so that its longer lines up with the box on the lower left. You should now have three stacked boxes: what are the dimensions of the larger box they form?|
|52|Yes; no; yes|
|53|When $n$ is odd.|
|54|-----|
|55|All odd primes can be written <br>as a difference of squares. However, they can only be <br>written one way.|
|56|Write the two numbers <br>as <span>$10a + b$</span> and <span>$10a + (10 - b)$</span> and multiply them together to see how this works.|
