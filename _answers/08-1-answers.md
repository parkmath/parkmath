|1-3|1 and 3 both involve repeated multiplication by a ratio.|
|4|Sequences that have a common ratio between successive terms.|
|5 a|T1 ∙3∙3|
|5 b|T1 ∙33|
|5 c|T1 ∙3n-1|
|6|T5 = 80; T7 = 640|
|7|The ratio between terms is not constant.|
|8 a|13.5, 20.25|
|8 b|Tn = 4 ∙1.5n-1|
|8 c|Answers vary|
|9 a-e|Answers vary|
|10 a|x = 25|
|10 b|x = 75|
|10 c|x = 25/2 with r = 5; x = 2/25 with r = 1/5|
|10 d|For the first sequence, 25/5 = 125/25 and we see that the common ratio is 5.|
|12|T4 = 6.75; T14 = 389.24; 28 terms|
|13|T4 = 1/2; T14 = 1/(211). With r = ¼, T4 = 1/(24); T14 = 1/(224).|
|14|64|

|16|The terms will keep getting closer to 0.|
|17|T7 = 24,576|
|18|r = 4|
|19 a|Positive|
|19 b|Negative|
|20|Yes. Here’s one example: 3, 3, 3, 3…|
|21|No|
|23|Answers vary, but here’s an example: 5, 10, 20, … <br>5, -10, 20, …|
|24|Even values of n |
|25 a|126|
|25 b|1/A|
|25 c|Next(a, b) = b ∙ b/a = b2/a|
|25 d|768|
|26 a|r3|
|26 b|1/r6|

|31|1023/256 or 3.996|
|32|Answers vary. An example: Multiply the last term by the ratio again, and then subtract the first term. Divide that result by r-1.|
|33 a|16,276,042|
|33 b|8|
|33 c|4781/256 or 18.68|
|34 a|2059/8 or 257.375|
|34 b|422|
|34 c|1010.10101010101010101|
|35 b|524,288|
|35 c|1,048,575|
|35 d|19|
|36|375(1 - 1.21(n+1))/(-0.21)|

|38|254.54|
|39|1.5|
|40|No because 4,921 is not <br>divisible by 3.|
|41 a|rn would become so small, it would basically be 0.|
|41 b|1|
|41 c|1/3|
|42 a|7/12|
|42 b|<span>$ - 2 \pm \sqrt 5 $</span>|

|42 d|(xy4 + 1)/(x3y3)|
|42 e|0|
|43 c|1/3 unit|
|43 e|2/27 unit|
|43 f|16/19683|
|43 g|(1/3)(2/9)(n-1)|
