    <h1>Linear Equations</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>Your 8-year-old neighbor Joe has set up a lemonade stand.
      To help him out you agree to buy a cup, but are surprised to
      find that he charges for the cup as well as the lemonade. His
      price is 30 cents for the cup itself, and then 80 cents per
      cupful of lemonade.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. How much would Joe charge for
      someone who bought the cup and then drank 5 cupfuls?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Beth spends $5.90 at the lemonade
      stand. How much lemonade did she drink?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. You realize that you have less than
      a dollar’s worth of change, so you can’t buy a full cup. How
      much do you think Joe should charge you for getting a cup
      that’s half full of lemonade? (Remember you still need to pay
      for the cup!)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. How much should Joe charge for a
      cup that’s 90% full?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Write an equation for P, the price
      of your purchase, in terms of L, the amount of lemonade that
      you buy, measured in cupfuls (which might not be a whole
      number).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Linear equations are used to model the same kinds of
    patterns that you see in arithmetic sequences — patterns where
    the data show a steady rate of change. One benefit of a linear
    equation is that you’re no longer restricted to whole numbers —
    you can find the price of 3.42 cupfuls of lemonade — whereas
    with a sequence, you could only have the price of 1 cup, the
    price of 2 cups, the price of 3 cups, and so on.</p>

    <p>When you graph a linear equation, one of the most critical
    pieces of information you see on the graph is the slope of the
    line. Recall that slope is a measure of the steepness of a
    line, and is calculated by finding “rise over run” — for
    example, the line below “rises” 6 units every time it “runs” 4
    units, so its slope is 6 over 4, or 1.5.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>This lesson underscores the advantages of using multiple
    points of view — looking at problems or situations from several
    perspectives. Specifically we will see how shifting among
    sequences, graphs and algebraic equations can make a difficult
    problem quite accessible.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>In an arithmetic sequence, ${T_1} = 10{\rm{, }}{T_2} =
      14{\rm{, }}{T_3} = 18{\rm{, }}{T_4} = $ …</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Graph the points of this arithmetic
      sequence on a coordinate plane (use x to stand for n, and y
      to stand for ${T_n}$ ).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Draw the line that goes through the
      points you drew.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What is the rate of change of the
      sequence? In what way is this rate related to the line?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Write an equation of the line — an
      equation showing the relationship between x and y.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. The points $\left( {a,30} \right)$
      and $\left( {b,60} \right)$ are on the line. Use your
      equation in part d to find a and b.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>Two terms of an arithmetic sequence are ${B_3} = 40$ 䧔z
      and ${B_{10}} = 68$ .</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. If you graphed the points of the
      sequence, and then drew the line that goes through these two
      points, what would be the slope of the line you drew?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Find a, b, and c below:
      The points $\left( {12,a} \right)$ , , and $\left( {c,89}
      \right)$ would be on the line described in part a.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Write an equation for the line.
      Test it by plugging in 3 and 10 for x to make sure it
      works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>A line contains the points (12,9) and (3,10). Draw the
      line on a set of axes, then find:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. The slope of the line.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. An equation for the line.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. The value of x that will make y
      equal 12.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>The values of a sequence are represented by the equation
      $y = 4x - 9$ . (Here $x$ is playing the role of $n$, and $y$
      is
      playing the role of ${T_n}$ ).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Find the first term of the sequence
      ($x = 1$ ).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Find the rate of change of the
      sequence.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What’s the value of the 7th term of
      the sequence?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Which term of the sequence has a
      value of 31? (If you got 115, re-read the question!) Figure
      out a way to answer this question without writing out all the
      terms of the sequence until you get 31.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Will the number 111 ever appear in
      the sequence? If yes, when? If no, why not?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Will the number 173 ever appear in
      the sequence? If yes, when? If no, why not?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>A linear equation has the following graph:</p>
    </div>

    <p class="problem-part">. Use the graph to estimate the value
    of y when x is 4, and when x is 10.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">. Estimate the slope of the line.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">. Estimate the value of x for which y
    would equal 100.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">. Do you think the point would be on
    the line? How about ? Be precise in your explanation.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="7">
      <p>You have an aquarium with fish and snails in it. There’s a
      limited amount of oxygen in the tank and so the two species
      are in competition for the oxygen. The relationship between
      x, the number of fish living in the aquarium, and y, the
      number of snails living in the aquarium, is linear. The graph
      of the line is below:</p>
    </div>

    <p class="problem-part">. What’s the value of the y-intercept
    of this line, and what does it mean in the context of the
    problem situation?
    (Recall that the y-intercept of the graph is the point where
    the graph crosses the y-axis.)</p>

    <p class="problem-part">. What’s the value of the x-intercept
    of this line, and what does it mean in the context of the
    problem situation?
    (Recall that the x-intercept of the graph is the point where
    the graph crosses the x-axis.)</p>

    <p>It is customary to describe the x-and y-intercepts using
    only the x-or
    y-coordinate. For example, a line with y-intercept (0, 16) is
    said to have
    a y-intercept of 16.</p>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="8">
      <p>You write an important lab report, and want to have it
      printed professionally. The print shop tells you that in
      addition to paying a rate of 11 cents per page, you’ll also
      have to pay 75 cents for the cover and binding.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. If your lab report is 20 pages
      long, how much will it cost to get it printed?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. You change your writing to a
      smaller font to make it cheaper – now the report is only 17
      pages long. How much will it cost now?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. You need to make the report even
      shorter, because you want it to cost at most $2.25. How short
      does it need to be?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Write an equation to reflect the
      information. Use x to represent the number of pages, and use
      y to represent the price you pay.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Find d: $\left( {12,d} \right)$ is
      on the line.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Find w: $\left( {w,3} \right)$ is

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>Looking at two lines, you see that the point $\left( {3,3}
      \right)$ is on
      both lines.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. The x-intercept of the first line
      is 12. Find its slope.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. The slope of the second line is
      ${\raise0.5ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle 1$} \kern-0.1em/\kern-0.15em
      \lower0.25ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle 4$}}$ . Find its x-and

      <p>After considering the print shop from problem 8, you
      decide that you’d rather have your report printed at a
      different store. The new store has the same pricing system —
      a charge for the covers and binding, and a charge per page —
      but you forgot to ask about the specific rates.
      
      You do remember being told that a
      15-page report would cost $1.78 to print, and a 19-page
      report would cost $1.98.</p>
