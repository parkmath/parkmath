    <p>to focus on one part of a problem (or definition or concept)

  </section>

  <section>
    <div>
      <p>Looking at a large or complex problem can be fairly
      intimidating — where does one begin? It can seem that there
      is too much to take in all at once. Indeed, trying to
      understand the “whole” is often completely unhelpful at
      first, and we are better off just getting a handle on
      individual “parts” that make up the “whole”. To Take Things
      Apart is to break a problem down into smaller, more
      manageable “chunks” that we can understand. After we have
      solved the smaller problems, then we can use our results to
      rebuild the original problem and solve it.</p>

      <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
        <p>You put a rubber band around a 3x5 “grid” of
        circles.
        Each circle has radius 1.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="Habits---Inline-Diagram"><img src="images/05-0-take-things-apart/sphere%20packing.tif" alt="sphere%20packing.tif"></p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What is the length of the rubber
      band?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What percent of the area inside the
      rubber band is not
      contained in any circle?</p>

      <p>
      We don’t have a name for the shape we’re trying to find the
      perimeter of in part a — it looks like a rectangle, but it
      has rounded corners. But we can still find the perimeter by
      breaking the shape up into pieces. For instance, we can start
      by finding the lengths of the parts of the sides that are
      straight — how long are they? It may help to draw some lines
      to section off this part of the shape for which you already
      have the perimeter. Now look at the part of the shape that’s
      left. Can you figure out how to get the remaining
      perimeter?</p>

      <p>Now all that remains is to break the problem down into
      steps in order to figure out what to do. First let’s think
      about how to find a percentage of area. That’s going to be
      $\frac{{{\rm{The area inside the rubber band but not in the
      circles}}}}{{{\rm{The area inside the rubber band}}}}$ . This
      fraction
      
      tells us that we need to break this problem into two parts:
      find the numerator and find the denominator. To get the
      denominator, we might be able to use a “take things apart”
      process similar to our method in part a. To get the
      numerator, you will also need to come up with a plan.</p>

      <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
        <p>How many triangles are there whose three vertices are
        points on
        this 3 by 3 square grid? (Math Counts)</p>
      </div>

      <p>If you tackle this problem simply by drawing different
      triangles within the diagram, you might find yourself getting
      lost. In fact, all the overlapping triangles might lead you
      to think that you’ve found all of the triangles (when you
      probably haven’t), or you might just give up in the confusion
      of lines. So, one suggestion is to systematically take the
      diagram apart. First, look at the top-left square of points.
      How many triangles are there in this square? Now, how many of
      these squares exist in the 3 by 3 grid? So, how many
      triangles are there in the 3 by 3 grid that are of the form
      that fit into the top-left square?</p>

      <p>Now let’s look for more triangles. Instead of using
      a square, expand your boundary shape to a 2x3
      rectangle. Draw all the possible triangles that fit within
      the rectangle, excluding the ones you’ve already counted as
      part of a square. Now you can again multiply your answer by
      the number of rectangles that occur in the grid. Should you
      count overlapping rectangles or not?</p>

      <p>Now, complete the problem by counting the rest
      of the triangles. While this problem takes some effort at
      solving, it certainly takes less effort if you take the
      diagram apart and build up the count in
      a step-by-step fashion. What’s more, counting
      systematically will increase your confidence that you’ve in
      fact found every triangle.</p>

        <p>The Physicist Enrico Fermi was famous for asking

        even approach. For example, to solve</p>

        <p class="problem-part">. How many pounds of trash do U.S.
        households throw out every year?
        
        
        You might start with a quantity that is easier for you to
        reasonably estimate: the weight of the trash that your
        family throws out in a given week. (If it is your job to
        take the garbage out, you may be especially well-qualified
        to answer this question.) From there, you could reason from
        other well-known facts and reasonable guesses to scale up
        your answer to cover all U.S. households.
        
        These next few problems can similarly be solved by breaking
        the problem down into pieces and coming up with your best
        estimate (which is not the same as just guessing).</p>
