      <p>At Arnaldo’s small party, people shook hands with as many
      people they liked, from 0 up to everyone else at the party.
      Nayla has been paying close attention, and says that if you
      add up everyone’s personal “handshake total”, you will get
      15. Can she be correct? Explain.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Often in life, when someone says something that seems
    surprising, counter-intuitive, or even reasonable, we will look
    not at the conviction with which the speaker is speaking, but
    instead for the evidence and reasoning needed to back up their
    claim. In mathematics, we do the same thing. It is a fun fact
    of mathematics that many things that initially appear to be
    false are in fact true, and as well many things that appear to
    be true are false. So the only way to know if a statement is
    correct is to use clear reasoning based on assumptions we all
    agree upon.</p>

    <p>Proving is a way of demonstrating to yourself and others
    that something you think may be true (or false), must in fact
    be true (or false). Although there are many different ways of
    proving a statement, everyone agrees that the steps of a proof
    should be clear: a careful reader should be able to read each
    step of your proof and see how it connects and follows from the
    one before. That way, at the conclusion of your proof, they
    will agree with you!</p>

    <p>In the “Arnaldo’s party” problem above, at first it may seem
    a bit mystifying how to approach testing Nayla’s claim.
    Probably the best thing to do at first is to Tinker by trying
    to see if you can get a “handshake total” for all party members
    to be equal or close to 15. If you can get to exactly 15,
    you’re done; Nayla is correct, and the problem is over. On the
    other hand, if you have tried a number of different handshake
    “scenarios” and only gotten close to 15 in each case,
    nevertheless you will probably have noticed something
    interesting about handshake totals in general—something you
    might try to prove (and which will tell us if Nayla can be
    correct as well).</p>

    <p>So, when presented with a claim, do three things. First,
    decide whether it seems reasonable – do you believe it at first
    glance? Next, try to find evidence that the claim is or is not
    true. Finally, for any claim that you believe to be true, try
    to prove that it’s true by making a sequence of logical
    statements, each of which your peers could understand and agree
    to; and for any claim you believe to be false, provide an
    example that shows the claim is false—such an example is called
    a counterexample.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>Here’s a problem that many students have enjoyed:</p>
    </div>

    <p class="Habits-Lesson---Problem-Flow">
    A 64-square black and white checkerboard (see above) can
    clearly be completely covered by 32 dominos. If the top right
    and bottom left squares are removed, what is left is a
    62-square board. How many dominoes will be required to cover
    the 62-square board?</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>[Continuation of problem 2] Did you check your answer to
      problem 2? A 64 square checkerboard is covered by 32 dominoes
      since every domino covers 2 squares, a white one and a black
      one. In the altered checkerboard, how many black squares are
      there? How many white squares? Would 31 dominoes do the
      job?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here’s another problem that might seem very tricky at first,
    but with a little persistence and some tinkering . . .</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>In a stock market game, Traci claims that she can purchase
      any stock above $26 by using only $5 and $6 coupons. (For
      example, there is no way she could purchase $13 of stock with
      these coupons, but she could purchase $41 of stock by using
      one $6 coupon and seven $5 coupons.) Do you think that Traci
      can really pull this off?</p>
    </div>

    <p>As a token of our affection to you, the answer is given on
    the reverse.</p>

    <p>While it may seem plausible that there is always some
    combination of $5 and $6 coupons that is equivalent to a
    specific amount of money, it at first seems unlikely that we
    may be able to prove that any amount over $26 can be produced
    by some combination of the two coupons. How would we know for
    sure that $329876 could be paid out?</p>

    <p>Our best strategy is to begin by tinkering, and then see if
    there are any interesting patterns that emerge. We can then try
    to establish through careful reasoning that the patterns we see
    are no fluke, that they have to continue.</p>

    <p>So let’s start.</p>

    <p>The first few dollar amounts one can figure out just by
    Tinkering:</p>

    <p>$27 stock can be paid by using three $5 coupons and two $6
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$28 stock can be paid by using two $5 coupons and three $6
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$29 stock can be paid by using one $5 coupon and four $6
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$30 stock can be paid by using no $5 coupons and five $6
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$31 stock can be paid by using five $5 coupons and one $6
    coupon.</p>

    <p>Wait a second. Isn’t this sort of tedious? Doesn’t it seem
    like this approach would take us forever, and even then we
    would still have an infinity of numbers left to check? And
    weren’t we supposed to look for a pattern? There doesn’t seem
    to be any pattern in the $5’s and $6’s at all.</p>

    <p>Well, let’s think about a $32 stock. Traci knows how to
    purchase a $27 stock—three $5 coupons and two $6 coupons. What
    coupon should she now add in order to purchase a $32 stock?</p>

    <p>Now convince yourself that Traci’s claim is valid.</p>
