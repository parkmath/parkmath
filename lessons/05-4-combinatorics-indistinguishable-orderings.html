<h1>Combinatorics: When Order Matters or Not</h1>

    <h2>Introduction: Hey batta! Hey batta!</h2>

    <p>Jan bats .500 in softball — i.e., on average, for each 10
    at-bats she gets five hits. We wish to determine the
    probability that she will get no hits if she comes to bat 5
    times during a game. In order to calculate this probability we
    must assume that she stays a “.500 hitter” from one at-bat to
    the next, which is to say that success or failure at each
    at-bat is not affected by the previous at-bats. Given this
    assumption we can perform the following calculation:</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>What is the probability that Jan will get exactly one hit
      in 5 at-bats?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>What’s the probability that Jan will get exactly 4 hits in
      5 at-bats?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>What’s the probability that Jan will get exactly 2
      hits?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last question probably took some time to calculate since
    there are 10 different ways for Jan to get exactly 2 hits. For
    example, one string of at-bats might look like HNHNN, where H =
    “hit” and N = “no hit”. Imagine trying to calculate the
    probability that Jan would get exactly 3 hits in 10 at-bats.
    Don’t do this by listing all the strings of 10 at-bats with 3
    hits. You will be cursing by the end of this process, if not
    earlier. Fortunately, there is a more elegant way of counting
    how many strings have exactly 3 hits in 10 at-bats. Let’s look
    at one approach.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>This approach will require us, first, to review two basic
    counting principles that you learned last year. Suppose you’re
    setting up a password for a new account.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>If the password must be 3 letters followed by 3 digits,
      then how many possible passwords are there? The password is
      not case-sensitive so there’s no distinction between “a” and
      “A”.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>If the password must be 3 letters followed by 3 digits,
      but no letter or digit can be repeated, then how many
      passwords are there? Again, the passwords are not
      case-sensitive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>If the password must be 10 digits, no letters, with no
      repetition, then how many passwords are there? There’s a nice
      shorthand way of writing this answer. Do you remember it?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The problems above involve a basic principle of counting
    called the Multiplication Principle of Counting. You also
    needed to pay attention to whether repetition mattered. Lastly,
    Problem 6 alludes to some shorthand notation that comes in
    handy when the final count gets very large. Keep in mind that
    this is only notation and doesn’t solve problems for you. As
    you progress through this lesson, you’ll need to remember that
    the formulas you might derive are not all-purpose ones that
    solve counting problems. They tend to work in highly
    specialized situations. You will find more success if you read
    each problem carefully, think about what is being counted
    (visualize, even), and then apply basic principles like the
    Multiplication Principle of Counting. Now, let’s see how to
    tackle the batting problem by looking at a similar problem.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="7">
      <p>The word error has 5 letters in it, two letters that
      appear once and one that appears three times. We’re going to
      look at different 5-letter “words” that can be formed by
      rearranging these 5 letters. These words need not make any
      sense, so “rroer” is a word.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. How many 5-letter words can be
      formed, assuming that you can tell the difference between the
      r’s? In other words, think of the r’s as being a red r, a
      blue r, and a green r (or as ${r_1}$ , ${r_2}$ , and ${r_3}$
      ). By the way, each of the letters can only be used once per
      word.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Write down two 5-letter words that
      differ from each other only if the r’s are different colors.
      How many other 5-letter words differ from these two only if
      the r’s are different colors?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Think of another 5-letter word that
      is different from the ones in Part b. How many versions are
      there of this
      5-letter word that are distinguishable from each other
      only
      if the r’s are different colors? Would all of these 5-letter
      words be part of the count you made in Part a?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. So, how many 5-letter words can be
      formed by rearranging the letters in error, if each letter
      can only be used once per word (and the r’s are
      indistinguishable from each other)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Lastly, you should be able to write
      your answer to Part d in the form ${\raise0.7ex\hbox{${5!}$}
      \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{5!}
      {n!}}}\right.\kern-\nulldelimiterspace}
      \!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${n!}$}}$ . What is n?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="8">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
      the letters in freestone, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="9">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
      the letters in freewheel, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
      the letters in appraisal, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="11">
      <p>Using the letters H, H, H, H, H, N, N, N, N, N, N, N only,
      how many 12-letter words can be formed? (Note: though the
      word “distinguishable” is not appearing you should
      assume you are just counting words that are different from
      each other.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the previous problems you were always counting letters.
    If you think about what you were doing, however, you should
    realize that the method of counting wasn’t dependent on
    letters. Problem 11, for example, could have initially been a
    problem about how many ways can you step right five times and
    left seven times in a sequence of twelve steps.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="12">
      <p>Bill is flipping a coin 8 times, keeping track of the
      sequence of heads and tails. What is the probability that
      he’ll get
      exactly 5 heads in total? Exactly 4 heads? 3 heads?</p>

      <p>Alix’s mathematics class wants to form a committee of 4
      students to investigate whether AP classes should be taught
      in the school. If there are 16 students in the class then how
      many different committees can be formed?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last problem may have seemed quite different from the
    previous ones, but there is a way of seeing it as no different.
    Imagine that you’re working with all 16 students and that you
    have 16 Velcro labels. Twelve of these labels are a large N and
    four of them are a large Y. You line the 16 students up and
    then try to count how many different ways you can assign the
    labels to the students. In this sense, you are trying to
    determine how many different ways you can arrange 12 N’s and 4
    Y’s in a sequence.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="14">
      <p>The answer to the last sentence (and to Problem 13) can be
      written in the form $\frac{{a!}}{{b!{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}
      {\kern 1pt} c!}}$ , where a, b, and c have specific meanings
      in the context of the problem. What are a, b, and c and what
      are their meanings?</p>

      <p>The fraction in Problem 14 can be simplified so that there
      is only one factorial expression in the denominator. Do
      this.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Look back at your answer to Problem 15 and remember that
    this fraction is an answer to Problem 13. Now, use your
    understanding of the relationship between this fraction and
    Alix’s committee problem to answer the following question.</p>

      <p>You’re going to order a triple-scoop bowl of ice
      cream.
      If you plan on choosing three different types of ice cream
      from 8 possible choices, then how many different triple-scoop
      combinations are there?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In this lesson you have seen some problems where two
    different orderings of the same things are to be thought of as
    being different — e.g., the passwords 3857210964 and
    6710892534. In other problems, you’ve had to discount these
    differences — e.g., the triple-scoop combination of
    chocolate-vanilla-pistachio does not differ from the
    combination pistachio-chocolate-vanilla. As you work through
    the remaining problems in these lessons, bear in mind these
    distinctions. Some problems will fall into one category and not
    the other, while some will fall into both. And, of course, some
    will fall into neither.</p>

      What if you were trying to create all the possible 7 card
      hands? What about all the possible 52 card hands? Check your
      3 estimates with a calculator and see if you were right in
