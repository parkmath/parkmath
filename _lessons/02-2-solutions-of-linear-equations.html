  <h1>Lesson 2: Solutions of Linear Equations</h1>
  <section class="development">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The business of solving equations can sometimes be a simple
    matter, and at times could become quite complicated. It can
    range from the relatively simple task of finding a value of x
    that satisfies the equation $3 + x = 7$ to a problem that turns
    out to be impossible, that of finding positive integers $a$,
    $b$, and $c$ that satisfy the equation, ${a^3} + {b^3} = {c^3}$.</p>

    <p>Then there are those equations that have so many solutions
    that it would be
    impossible to write them all out. What if someone challenged
    you to find the two numbers they are thinking of and the only
    clue you had was that the sum of the numbers is 100? You are
    actually invited to solve the equation, $x + y = 100$; the
    possibilities are endless.</p>

    <p>Or what if you were faced with the task of writing out all
    the solutions to the equation $x + 3 - 5 = 9x - 8x - 2$ or to
    the inequality $3x + 6 &lt; 8$?</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>By way of review, solve each of the following equations
      and inequalities for the unknown letter. Remember to be
      particularly careful with the inequalities. In particular,
      when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, you always
      have to reverse the inequality. Why must this be so?</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="a">. $2y - 3y = 7 + 4y$</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="b">. $3.5x - 4 = 7 - 7.5x$</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="c">. $5\left( {r - 5} \right) - 3\left(
      {2 - r} \right) + 35 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="d">. $3\left( {x - 4} \right) + 15 = 35
      - 5\left( {2 - 5x} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="e">. $17x + 5 &lt; 31x - 2$</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="f">. $2\left( {3.5x - 7.5x} \right) + 4
      &gt; 1$</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="g">. $8 - \left( {7 - n} \right) =
      33$</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="h">. $- {\textstyle{1 \over 3}}c =
      17$</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="i">. $- 3 + {\textstyle{d \over 7}} =
      - 12$</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="j">. $3\left( {2 + 3x} \right) = 13 -
      4\left( {3 - x} \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>To write all the solutions to the equation $3x + 7 = 22$ is
    a pretty simple task, since $x$ can be replaced by only one
    number to make the equation work, namely 5. Check it out.</p>

    <p>The question of what values of $x$ and $y$ make the equation $2x
    + y = 13$ work is a slightly more complicated question, and it
    is certainly no easy matter to find all the values of $x$ and $y$ that make the equation work.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>Does $x = 3$, $y = 6$ work? How about $x = 7$, $y = - 1$? 
      What about $x = \tfrac{1}{4}$, $y = \tfrac{25}{2}$? 
      Justify your responses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>Find three more solutions to the equation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>What would be a systematic way of finding solutions? Use
      your method to find two other solutions.</p>
    </div>

    <p>By the way, a neat way to write a solution like $x = 7$ and
    $y = - 1$ is $(7,-1)$, with the $x$-value
    written first, followed by the $y$-value. The expression
    $(7,-1)$ is called an <em class="vocab">ordered pair</em>. Any idea
    why?</p>

    <p>Can you list <em>all</em> the solutions to the equation $2x + y = 13$?</p>
    
    <p>The answer is probably no, since there are simply too many, but
    from your work in Lesson 1 you should know that there is a nice
    way to show off a whole bunch of them very quickly.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>Show that and are both solutions to the equation $2x + y =
      13$, and graph these two points. Now graph at least ten
      thousand solutions to the equation in less than ten
      seconds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>How accurate is your graph in problem 5? For example,
      suppose you wanted to determine whether the ordered
      pair $(\tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{49}{4})$ is a solution to the equation $2x + y = 13$.
      How much would you be willing to bet on the answer
      you obtained from your graph?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Now let’s look at the inequality $2x + y &gt; 13$. Can you
    list all the solutions? If not, is there a nice way you can
    show off a whole bunch of them very quickly?</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="7">
      <p>For the inequality $2x + y &gt; 13$:</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="a">. Does the ordered pair $\left( {5,2}
      \right)$ satisfy it? How about $\left( {7,1} \right)$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="b">. List five ordered pairs that
      satisfy it.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="c">. Find three ordered pairs $\left(
      {x,y} \right)$ that satisfy it and are such that $2x + y$ is
      as close to 13 as you can get.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="d">. Then find three ordered pairs
      $\left( {x,y} \right)$ that do not satisfy it, but are such
      that $2x + y$ is as close to 13 as you can get.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="8">
      <p>Now draw a picture of a few thousand solutions to the
      inequality in problem 7.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You are used to graphing equations. The picture you drew in
    problems 7 and 8 is called the graph of the inequality $2x + y
    &gt; 13$.</p>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="9">
      <p>Find three different solutions to the equation $5x - 3y =
      11$, including at least one integral solution (a solution
      consisting only of integers).</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>Using the method of problems 7 and 8, graph solutions of
      the inequality $5x - 3y &lt; - 1$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="11">
      <p>Graph solutions of the equation $x + 3y = 11$. Say

      solution.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="c">. Both $(\tfrac{3}{2}, -\tfrac{1}{2})$ and $\left( {3, - 1} \right)$ are solutions.</p>

      <p>In what way(s) would a graph of $2x + y \geq 13$ be different from the

      <p><em>The Linear Game</em></p>
      
      <p>In this game, the host, Eva, thinks up a
      linear equation in two variables x and y. She then invites a
      contestant, say Lewis,
      to come up with the equation using the following approach.
      Lewis calls out
      an x or y value and Eva tells him the
      corresponding y or x value.</p>
      
      <p>For example, suppose Eva is thinking of the equation $3x - y
      = 11$ and Lewis says $x = 1$, then Eva says $y = - 8$, and
      if Lewis says $y = 3$, Eva says $x = \tfrac{14}{3}$. This continues until Lewis is able to figure out what
      Eva’s equation is.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="a">. How many tries does Lewis
      absolutely need to get Eva’s equation?</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="b">. Below is a summary of four of the
      Eva-hosted games. In each case, guess Eva’s equation.</p>
