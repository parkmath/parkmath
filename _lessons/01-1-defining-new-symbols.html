    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>You have a pocket calculator that can only do one thing —
    when you type in two whole numbers, it takes the first number,
    adds the second number to it, adds the first number to the sum,
    then takes that whole answer and multiplies it by the second
    number. The number you see on the screen is its final answer
    after this series of steps.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you type in 7 and 2, what will your calculator
      show?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What if you type in 2 then 7?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your friend uses the calculator. You can’t see the first
      number
      she types in, but the second number is 3. The answer that the
      calculator gives is 39. What was the first number?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>The calculator’s rule (from the problems above) has a symbol
    to represent it: “$\triangle$”.
    For example, “$7\triangle2$” refers to what you did in question #1.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $2\triangle10$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $2\triangle y$, in terms of $y$? Simplify as much as possible
      (no parentheses in your answer).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $x\triangle8$ ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $x\triangle y$, in terms of $x$ and $y$? Write this as an
      equation.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you invented the symbol “$\triangle$” for a
    math problem you wrote, and wanted to explain it in an equation
    rather than in words, you would say:</p>

    <p>“Let $x\triangle y$ _______________________” (your answer to question
    7).</p>

    <p>This is called the algebraic rule for $\triangle$.</p>

    <p>Here the word “Let” is used the same way as when a problem
    says “Let $x$ be the number of boxes you purchase.”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>After trying out a few different whole numbers as inputs
      to the $\triangle$ rule,
      John makes the following claim: “To get an odd number for
      your answer from $\triangle$, you need to input odd numbers for $a$ and
      $b$.”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Does John’s claim seem reasonable
      to you? If it doesn’t, find a counterexample — a specific
      example which proves that his statement is not always
      true.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is John’s claim true?</p>
    </div>

    <p>These two questions are quite different — in many
    situations, there can be a variety of different predictions
    that seem reasonable, but only one of them may be actually
    true! The habit of seeking proof is not only about learning how
    to prove a statement to be true — it’s also about learning to
    ask “Why would that be true?” when you are presented with a
    reasonable statement.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The symbol “&amp;”, applied to two whole numbers, means
      that you take the first number and then add the product of
      the numbers.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $4{\rm{\&amp; }}{\kern 1pt}
      {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} 7$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $7{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}
      {\rm{\&amp; }}{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\rm{4}}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an algebraic rule for
      &amp;.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Here is another of John’s claims.
      “To get an odd number for your answer from $a{\kern 1pt}
      {\kern 1pt} {\rm{\&amp; }}{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}
      b$, you need to input an odd number for $a$ and an even
      number for $b$.”
      
      Is his new claim true? If you think it is true, carefully
      explain why.
      
      If you believe it’s not true, give a counterexample.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Just like any symbol regularly used in mathematics
      ($+ , - , \cdot , \div $), symbols that we create can be
      used inside
      an equation.
      
      Let $m \unicode{x263c} n = 3n - m$. Calculate the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$5\unicode{x263c}2$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$6 \cdot (5\unicode{x263c}2)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$(1\unicode{x263c}3.5)$$- {\rm{ }}(3.5\unicode{x263c}1)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$2\unicode{x263c}(3\unicode{x263c}5)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$(2\unicode{x263c}3)\unicode{x263c} 5$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$(a\unicode{x263c}b)\unicode{x263c}c$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In problem 10, is $m \unicode{x263c} n = n\unicode{x263c}m$ true in general, for
      ANY input numbers $m$ and $n$? Explain.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
    <div class="problem">
      <p>When you give $\unicode{x00a9}$ two numbers, it gives you the
      third number in the addition/subtraction pattern. For
      example, $\unicode{x00a9}\left\{ {21,23} \right\} = 25$ (going up
      by $2$’s), and $©\left\{ {95,90} \right\} = 85$ (going
      down by $5$’s).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $\unicode{x00a9} \left\{ {6,11} \right\}$ and $\unicode{x00a9} \left\{ {11,6} \right\}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $\unicode{x00a9}\left\{
      {11,\unicode{x00a9}\left\{ {6,11} \right\}} \right\}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an equation for
      $\unicode{x00a9}\left\{ {m,n} \right\}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>When you give $\unicode{x24}$  two numbers, it gives you the third number
      in the multiplication/
      division pattern. For example,
      $\unicode{x24}\{3,15\} = 75$, and $\unicode{x24}\{48,24\} = 12.$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $\unicode{x24}\{2,3\}$, $\unicode{x24}\{12,13\}$, and
      $\unicode{x24}\{102,103\}.$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $\unicode{x24}\{2009,1\}$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If $\unicode{x24}\{x,2\} = \unicode{x24}\{3,1\}$, then what is
      $x$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The symbol ¤ takes a single number, squares it, and then
      subtracts 4.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is ¤(6)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can you ever get a negative answer
      for ¤($x$)? Why or why not?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find an $x$ so that ¤($x$) is
      divisible
      by 5.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let the symbol $\unicode{xa5}$ mean: Add up the
      two numbers, then take that answer and subtract it from the
      product of the two numbers. What is $5\unicode{xa5}8$?  $8 \unicode{xa5} 5$?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Look back at the problem above. Do you think the same
      thing would happen for any pair of numbers, if you used the
      same symbol? Explain your answer.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When switching the order of the input numbers never has an
    effect on the answer, the symbol you are working with is said
    to have the commutative property. For example, the symbol $\unicode{xa5}$
    (from
    questions 15 and 16 above) had the commutative property, but
    the symbol © (from question 12)
    did not.</p>

    <p> One important thing to note is that there's no such thing as "sometimes" having the commutative property. For example, $\unicode{xa5}$ has the commutative property because
    $a\unicode{xa5}b$ and $b\unicode{xa5}a$ are equal for ANY
    input numbers $a$ and $b$, not just because it worked for 5 and
    8.</p>

    <p>Proving a statement false is as easy as finding one
    counterexample, but it is sometimes difficult to prove that a
    statement that appears to be true is indeed true. In the
    following problems (17-21), you will need to decide whether
    statements are true or false, and to also clearly support your
    position.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Fergie claims that each of the following symbols has the
      commutative property. Examine each of his claims.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern
      1pt} {\rm{\$}}{\kern 1pt} y$ means add 1 to $y$, multiply
      that answer by $x$, and then subtract $x$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Take two whole numbers $x$ and $y$.
      To do $x{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} {\rm{\% }}{\kern
      1pt} y$, you divide $x$ by 2, round down if it’s not a whole
      number, and then multiply by $y$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">To calculate $x\unicode{xa3} y$, imagine that you walk $x$ miles east and then $y$ miles northeast. $x\unicode{xa3}y$ is how far away you end up
      from your starting point.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\unicode{xbf}$ works by adding up the two numbers,
      multiplying that by the first number, and then adding the
      square of the second number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\unicode{xa2}$ takes two numbers.
      You reverse the first number (for instance, 513 becomes 315);
      one-digit numbers stay the same), then add the reversed
      number to the second number, and finally add up the digits of
      your answer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let $x \unicode{x2605} \enspace y = x^2-y^2$. For example, $4 \unicode{x2605} \enspace 3 = 16-9 = 7$. True or false: $x \unicode{x2605} \enspace y$ always equals the sum
      of the two numbers — for example, $4 \unicode{x2605} \enspace 3 = 7$ which equals $4 + 3$. If
      it’s true, justify your claim. If
      it’s false, try to find out what kinds of numbers do make the
      claim work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>When you give $\unicode{x24c7} \enspace$ two numbers, it finds the sum of the two
      numbers, then multiplies the result by the first number.
      Finally it subtracts the square of the first number. Flinch
      claims that $\unicode{x24c7} \enspace$ is commutative. Is he correct?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here’s how you might prove Flinch’s claim in problem 19
      for $any$ two starting numbers.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Let’s call your first number $m$ and your second number $n$. Write down and simplify as much
      as you can the expression for $m \unicode{x24c7} \enspace n$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write down and simplify as much as
      you can the expression for $n\unicode{x24c7} \enspace m$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You should be able to convince anyone, using your work in
    problem 20 that Flinch’s statement is always true, no matter
    which numbers we start with.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is the rule below commutative?
      
      The rule $\unicode{x223c}$ adds up the two numbers, doubles the
      answer, multiplies the answer by the first number, then adds
      the square of the second number and subtracts the square of
      the first number.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let $x \clubsuit y = \frac{1}{{1,000,000,000}}{x^y}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is there a value of $y$ such that
      $10 \clubsuit y &gt; 1$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is there a value of $y$ such that
      $1.001 \clubsuit y &gt; 1$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The symbol “&amp;”, applied to $any$ two numbers (not only

      <p>A positive whole number is called a “staircase number” if
      the digits of the number go up from left to right. For
      example, 1389 works but not 1549.</p>
    

    <p>The rule $x \nabla y$works by gluing $x$ and $y$ together. For example, $63 \nabla 998$ gives an answer of 63998. If $x$ and $y$ are both staircase numbers, and $x$ is bigger than $y$,
    is it always true that $x \nabla y$ is bigger than $y \nabla x$ ? If you think it’s
    always true, explain why. If not, explain what kind of input
    would make it true.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For a number $x$ that might not be a whole number, $\Phi
      \left( x \right)$ represents the integral part of $x$— for
      example $\Phi \left( {6.51} \right)$ is 6 and $\Phi \left(
      {10} \right)$ is 10. Using the $\Phi $ notation, write a rule
      that gives an answer of 0 if $x$ is a whole number, and gives
      a non-zero answer if $x$ is not a whole number. For example
      should equal 0 and should give an answer not equal to
      zero.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The rule $\left[ b \right]$ is called the “greatest
      integer function” — it outputs the largest integer that is

      $\left[ {12} \right] = 12$, $\left[ {.92} \right] = 0$, and
      so on.</p>

    <p>Write an equation for the
    rule $\left\{ b \right\}$, which rounds $b$ down to the
    hundreds — for example $\left\{ {302} \right\} = 300$,
    $\left\{ {599} \right\} = 500$, and $\left\{ 2 \right\} = 0$.
    For your equation to calculate $\left\{ b \right\}$, you can
    use any standard operations, and you should use the operation
    $\left[ b \right]$.</p>

      <p>To understand the rule behind the

      pick a point to start and then draw a line stretching 5 units
      to the right. From there, draw a line stretching
      3 units up. Then draw a line stretching
      3 units to the right, and then a line stretching 5 units up.
      Finally, draw a line back to your starting point.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Let $5\diamondsuit 3$ be the area

      $5\diamondsuit 3$ and for your numbers in part b.</p>
