<h1>Lesson 4: Logic and Finite Geometry</h1>
  <section class="development">


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Last year, you discovered that whenever you inscribed a
    triangle in a circle with one side being a diameter of the
    circle, the triangle seemed to be a right triangle. And some of
    you might have concluded, not without good reason, that
    this
    must always be the case. This kind of reasoning is called
    $inductive reasoning$— when you use a set of examples to claim
    a general theory.</p>

    <p>Most of you, however, may have remained unconvinced that
    this would be always the case, and set out to prove it using
    some of the axioms of geometry. The kind of reasoning you used
    is called $deductive reasoning$— the kind of reasoning
    preferred by mathematicians, and the kind which will be the
    focus of this lesson.</p>

    <p>In mathematics, inductive reasoning is often used to make a
    guess at a property by examining some cases, and deductive
    reasoning (deduction) to prove that the property generally
    holds.</p>

    <p>As in the case of the circle example above the conclusion
    reached by inductive reasoning proved to be indeed correct, but
    in many cases, conclusions reached by inductive reasoning will
    turn out to be false. If you check the value of the expression
    for the first 10 or so positive integer values of $n$, you
    might conclude that was a prime number for any positive integer
    $n$. It turns out that this is not the case.</p>

    <p>Can you find a value for n such that the expression is not a
    prime number?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Which of the following do you think might be an example of
      deductive reasoning? Inductive reasoning? “Reasoning” that is
      neither inductive nor deductive? Explain.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. All dogs are friendly.
      All friendly things are huggable.
      If something is huggable then it’s a cat.
      Therefore, all dogs are cats.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. All dogs are blue.
      All animals are blue.
      Therefore, all dogs are animals.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Every year since records were kept,
      if it rained in Cyber City on a particular day, it has rained
      three days later.
      It rained in Cyber City this past Monday.
      Therefore, it will rain in Cyber City this Thursday.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Whenever the weather is fine, Rose
      goes to the beach.
      Rose is now at the beach.
      So the weather must be fine.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In this lesson not only will we explore logic problems
    including some similar to the ones in problem 1, but we will
    also introduce a different kind of geometry, called $finite
    geometry$. As its name suggests, finite geometry, unlike the
    geometry to which you are accustomed with an infinity of
    points, lines, planes, and so on, concerns itself solely with
    finite numbers of elements.</p>

    <p>We will study some of these geometries not only because of
    their quirky elegance but also because they provide a look into
    the nature of mathematical proof and help to sharpen your
    skills in developing valid logical arguments. They also show
    the power of visualization as an aid in solving more difficult
    problems.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>As you know from your work in Euclidean Geometry, any system
    of deductive reasoning consists of undefined terms,
    definitions, postulates (axioms), rules of logic (akin to
    common sense), and theorems (proved statements).</p>

    <p>Recall that a $postulate$($axiom)$ is a statement whose
    truth is to be accepted without proof, such as the line
    postulate in Euclidean Geometry, which states that one and only
    one line can be drawn through 2 distinct (different)
    points.</p>

    <p>And the truth of a $theorem$ is established by applying the
    rules of logic to the postulates. At each step in the proof of
    a theorem you must indicate which postulate you are applying,
    or which previously proved theorem you are drawing upon.</p>

    <p>Why must there be undefined terms? Is it possible to define
    every word/term? Try defining the color blue for a person who
    has no idea what blue is. And assume that if a person does not
    know what blue is, it is likely that the person will not know a
    host of other words associated with the color blue.</p>

    <p>But, of more importance, would the correctness of your
    reasoning be in
    question if some of the words used in the postulates were not
    defined? For example, supposed we replaced some of the words in
    problem 1a with words whose meanings you did not know, would
    you still conclude that it was a case
    of deductive reasoning?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is the following an example of deductive reasoning?
      Inductive reasoning? “Reasoning” that is neither inductive
      nor deductive?</p>

<p>      All blewters are sartoasted.
      All sartoasted things are ducated.
      If something is ducated then it’s an ook.
      Therefore, all blewters are ooks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s try to draw a conclusion using all of the three
      postulates below.</p>

<p>      Postulate 1. No ooks are acks.
      Postulate 2. All kooks are ooks.
      Postulate 3. All pocks are acks.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Draw, if possible, a diagram
      satisfying all three postulates using exactly 3 ooks, 2 kooks
      and 4 acks.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Compare your answer to part a with
      others. How many ooks did you have that were not kooks? How
      many acks did you have that were not pocks?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In problem 3, is it correct to conclude that no kooks are
      pocks? Prove your answer.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are a few different ways to solve problem 4. You might
    have used a kind of indirect argument, or, if you are more
    visually inclined, you might have used a Venn diagram, as
    suggested by problem 3.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s first look at an indirect argument.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. We’re eventually trying to prove
      that no kooks are pocks,
      but to start out, suppose that the opposite were true. That
      is, suppose there is some kook that is also a pock. Using
      Postulate 3, what conclusion can you draw about that
      kook?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Using your answer to part a, and
      Postulate 1, what new
      conclusion can you draw about our kook?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Now use Postulate 2 to complete
      your argument.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This kind of argument you used in problem 5 is called $proof
    by contradiction.$ Here is how it works. First, assume that the original statement
    you want to
    prove is false. Second, by reasoning from this assumption,
    reach a conclusion that is impossible — impossible, either
    because it contradicts a postulate or an established theorem,
    or because it contradicts the given information. Third, since
    assuming your original statement was false led to
    contradictions of known facts, you can now conclude that the
    original statement must instead be true.</p>

    <p>This kind of argument, proof by contradiction, makes use of
    a very important fact in the rules of logic — that any
    statement is equivalent to (exactly the same as) its
    $contrapositive$. Some of you may have encountered this term
    before. Here’s an example of a statement and its
    contrapositive.</p>

    <p>Statement: To be selected for Eightnotes you have to be a
    singing sensation.</p>

    <p>Contrapositive: If you are not a singing sensation, then you
    will not be selected to Eightnotes. [or you can kiss Eightnotes
    goodbye.]</p>

    <p>Here’s another:</p>

    <p>Statement: If an animal is a zebra, then it has stripes.</p>

    <p>Contrapositive: If an animal does not have stripes, then it
    is not a zebra.</p>

    <p>Would you agree that in the example above the statement and
    its contrapositive are equivalent? What follows is a somewhat
    less subtle use of the contrapositive. In the problem, x is
    considered to be an integer.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If x is not equal to 3, then ${x^3}$ is not equal to
      27.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Write the contrapositive of the
      above statement.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Is it easier to prove the statement
      directly, or to prove its contrapositive?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Back to problem 4. For a more visual approach, you might
    have represented each postulate by a Venn diagram (see below)
    and used the final picture to reach your conclusion.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-4-logic-and-finite-geometry/image4.tif.jpg" >
      $Postulate 1
      $</figure>

    <figure>

      <img src="../images/09-4-logic-and-finite-geometry/image51.tif.jpg" >
      $Postulate 2$<img src="../images/09-4-logic-and-finite-geometry/image61.tif.jpg" >
      $Postulate 3$</figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw Venn diagrams for the postulates in problems 1a and
      1b, and use them to check the answers you gave earlier.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Next we will take a look at some finite geometries. But
    before we explore a more traditional example with “points”,
    “lines”, etc., let’s look at one that might be a tad more
    familiar.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Postulate 1. There are six people and four
      entrees.&nbsp;
      Postulate 2. Everyone is sharing at least one entree with at
      least one other person.&nbsp;
      Postulate 3. Everyone is eating.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Draw out two different actual dinners that satisfy the
      postulates.&nbsp; In your diagrams you may use anything you
      please to represent people and entrees, but you have no
      choice regarding six and four.</p>

<p>      The diagrams you drew are called $models$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here is a more traditional one with three postulates. The
    terms “lines” and “points” are undefined and you must resist
    the temptation to think of these
    elements the way you did in Euclidean Geometry. For example, in
    a finite
    geometry a “line” cannot contain an infinite number of “points”
    since there
    are only a finite number of “points” in these geometries.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Postulate 1. There are 5 points and 5 lines.
      Postulate 2. Every line contains at least 2 points.
      Postulate 3. Every point is on at least one line.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Check that the following diagram
      represents the set of
      postulates — that, in fact, it is a model.
      </p>
    </div>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-4-logic-and-finite-geometry/diagram%209a.tif.jpg" >

    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">. The following is also a model for the
    system, but is
    essentially the same as the one above. Why does this claim make
    sense? (Think back to your graph theory lesson.)</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-4-logic-and-finite-geometry/diagram%209b.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>On a soccer team, 5 students are vying for 5 spots. The
      coach wants to make sure that there are at least 2 players
      for each position, and that each player gets to play in at
      least one position. Draw a model for this system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the postulates and models of problem 9, one group of
      students concluded that every point must be on at most two
      lines. Draw a model different from those in problem 7 to
      refute that claim.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Although models are extremely helpful in creating and
    examining conjectures, you have to be careful not to rely on
    models to construct proofs. In a very few cases it might be
    possible to construct every possible model satisfying all the
    postulates, but in general that would be very difficult to do.
    And even if you could construct all possible models, it might
    still be difficult to prove that you have done so. So to prove
    conclusions, you should reason directly from the
    postulates.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Based on your models in problems 9 and 11, make a claim,
      then try to refute it by drawing yet another model satisfying
      all the postulates of problem 9.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the following geometry with four postulates, lines and
      points are undefined.</p>

<p>      Postulate 1. There exist exactly 3 points.
      Postulate 2. Given any 2 points, there is exactly one line on
      them.
      Postulate 3. Not all points are on the same line.
      Postulate 4. Given any 2 lines, they are on at least one
      common point.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Draw a model.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Prove that 2 different lines cannot
      have more than one
      point in common. (You may use postulate 2 and proof by
      contradiction.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Can there be 4 lines?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Prove that not all lines have the
      same point in common.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Are there parallel lines in this
      system? (In finite geometries, two lines are $parallel$ if
      they do not share a common point.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Before working in any deductive system it is important to
    examine the postulates for $consistency$— is it possible for
    all the postulates to be true at the same time? The rule of
    thumb is that if you can draw a diagram to represent the set of
    postulates, then the postulates are consistent. Can you come up
    with some reasonable argument why drawing a diagram would allow
    the claim that the
    postulates are consistent? The systems in problems 8 and 9
    passed the test since we were able to construct a model for
    each.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Check the following system for consistency. Lines and
      points are undefined terms.</p>

<p>      Postulate 1. There are 4 points and 5 lines.
      Postulate 2. Every line contains exactly 2 points.
      Postulate 3. Every point is on exactly 2 lines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s now create a finite geometry that seems less
      abstract than the previous two.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Replace undefined terms “points”
      and “lines” in problem 13 by new undefined terms “students”
      and “committees” respectively, and rewrite the four
      postulates, changing the language a bit to make sense with
      the new terms.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Draw a chart of students and
      committees that would
      represent the postulates. (Your chart should have 3 rows
      for the 3 students, and as many columns for committees
      as you wish.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Are your postulates in part a
      consistent?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. How many committees did you finally
      end up with?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Is there a student who is on all
      committees?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Which of the following do you think might be an example of
      deductive reasoning? Explain.</p>

      Therefore, Jumbo is irresponsible.</p>

      <p>As we did in problem 15, let’s make
      problem 30 a little less abstract.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Replace undefined terms “points”
      and “lines” by new undefined terms (you use “students” and
      “committees” again if you like), and rewrite the postulates,
      changing the language a bit to accommodate the new terms.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Draw a chart that would represent
      the postulates. How many “points” did you end up with? How
      many “lines”?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Would the addition of another
      “point” or “line” violate any of the postulates?</p>

      <p>A system is considered $dependent$ if at least one of the
      axioms follows from the other axioms; otherwise it is
      considered $independent$. To show that a system is dependent,
      it is only necessary to show that one axiom follows from the
      others. However to show that a system is independent, one
      must show that no one axiom follows from the others.</p>
