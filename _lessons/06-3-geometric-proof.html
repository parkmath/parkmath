    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>C$’est Mathematique!$ is a French expression meaning that
    something is so certain, it is definite. Indeed, the
    19th-Century French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace imagined
    a demon that could predict every future event because it knew
    the exact position of every particle in the universe, and the
    mathematical laws that governed the motion of those
    particles.</p>

    <p>Though no such demon exists, we can see why Laplace might
    have imagined one. Our mathematical knowledge does seem more
    certain than some other facts we believe to be true about
    politics or human nature. For instance, maybe you think that
    passing laws to ban handguns will reduce homicides. Then you
    read a study that says that actually these bans don’t have that
    effect. You might change your mind about whether banning
    handguns is a good idea… until you read another study that says
      that the bans <em>do</em> reduce accidental death among children.
    You’ll always have to remain open to changing your opinion
    based on new information.</p>

    <p>Likewise, in the history of science, people once thought
    that the atom was the smallest particle that existed (the word
    “atom” comes from a Greek word
    meaning “indivisible”). Now we know that atoms are made up of
    protons and neutrons, and in recent decades scientists have
    discovered quarks. In the scientific community, people are
    constantly revising and improving accepted theories.</p>

    <p>In mathematics, on the other hand, we still accept the
    results of ancient texts. Archimedes, Pythagoras, and Euclid
    are credited with many of the results that we still use today.
    You have probably already proven things mathematically in such
    a way that you’re sure they must be true. In this lesson we’ll
    look at what it means for a proof to be absolutely airtight —
    with no possibility you’ll want to revise your opinion
    later.</p>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development</h2>

    <p>Let’s think about the following two statements:</p>

    <p><em>The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.</em></p>
    <p><em>The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect the angles from which
      they’re drawn.</em></p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make some sketches to determine whether you think each of
      these statements is true or false. Recall that “bisect” means
      “cut exactly in half.”</p>
    </div>

    <p>When we do proofs in this section, we’re going to focus on
    making them airtight. We’ll use the following standard. Any
    time we make a statement as part of a proof, we need to be able
    to give a reason for that statement. That reason, in turn,
    needs to be a statement about geometry that we $already$ know
    to be true.</p>

    <p>Here are some statements about geometry you already know to
    be true:</p>

    <div style="margin: 1em;">
    <p>In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the congruent
    sides are
      congruent.</p>

   <p>When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, same-side
    interior angles
     add up to 180 degrees.</p>

    <p>Vertical angles are equal.</p>

    <p>If two sides and the angle between them in one triangle are
    congruent to two sides and the angle between them in another
    triangle, then the triangles are congruent. (SAS congruence
      theorem)</p>
    <p>If the three sides of one triangle are all related to the sides
    of another
    triangle by the same proportion, then the triangles are
    similar.
    (SSS similarity theorem)</p>

<p>    In a parallelogram, opposite sides are congruent.</p>
                </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make a list of statements about geometry that you know to
      be true, including the six statements above. To get ideas,
      try paging through your notes from the past few weeks, or
      through the lessons earlier in this textbook. Which results
      seem worth remembering? Also think about some basic shapes
      you know, like quadrilaterals, and write down some facts you
      know to be true about each one.</p>
    </div>

    <p>As you may recall from the first lesson of this chapter, the
    Greek mathematician Euclid did something very similar to what
    you are about to do. He boiled down his geometric knowledge to
    a few assumptions and then proved the rest of what he knew
    about geometry using those few things. He called the facts he
    assumed without proof “postulates.” Any fact that he had proved
    was a “theorem.”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consolidate the list you made in the previous problem with
      the rest of the class. Discuss which items on it are
      postulates
      and which are theorems. Now separate a blank page of your
      notebook into two columns. Label one column “postulates” and
      the other “theorems.” Write the items in the class list
      in
      the appropriate column. Leave yourself lots of room in both
      columns to add to the list, probably over multiple pages.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Hang on to this list. You’ll be referring to it for the
    remainder of this chapter.</p>

    <p>Now let’s return to the problem of proving the statements
    from the beginning of this lesson. If you did your job
    carefully, you’ll have found that the first
    statement was true — the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect
    each other.</p>

    <p>Before writing our airtight proof of this fact, it’s
    important to know where to start. Since we’re proving something
    about a parallelogram, it’s all right to assume that we $have$ a parallelogram. So let’s draw one…</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/replacement parallelogram development.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>… and label the vertices so that we can talk about them
    later. So, specifically, $\overline {AD} \parallel \overline
    {BC} $ and $\overline {AB} \parallel \overline {DC} $. Those
    are two things we know for sure. It’s also important to be sure
    of what we want to show about this diagram. Let’s draw in some
    diagonals and call their intersection point E.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/parallelogram%202.svg" >
    </figure>

    <p>Then what we want to show is that $\overline {AE} \cong
    \overline {EC} $ and $\overline {BE} \cong \overline {ED} $.</p>

    <p>The comic book hero G.I. Joe used to say “knowing is half
    the battle.” In the case of proof, knowing what information you
    have to start with and where you want to end up with is half
    the battle. Really!</p>

    <p>What we need now is a chain of reasoning, beginning with the
    facts that $\overline {AD} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} \left\|
    {{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} \overline {BC} } \right.$ and
    $\overline {AB} \parallel \overline {DC} $ and ending with the
    statement that $\overline {AE} \cong \overline {EC} $ and
    $\overline {BE} \cong \overline {ED} $. In this chain of
    reasoning, every step needs to be justified with
    some reason we $know for sure$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Try this yourself before reading the proof on the next
      page.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When thinking about what will help us to write this proof,
    let’s think backwards a little bit. We want to show that
    certain lengths are the same. Look back at your list of
    postulates. What tools do you have for showing that lengths are
    the same? Not the results about parallel lines. Not vertical
    angles or linear pairs. Possibly some statements you have about
    parallelograms or rhombuses, but in this case the lengths we’re
    interested in are diagonals rather than sides of those shapes.
    That really only leaves one thing that could help — congruent
    triangles.</p>

    <p>If we can show that certain triangles are congruent, then we
    can conclude that the lengths making them up are also
    congruent. That should be our strategy in writing this
    proof.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find some congruent triangles in this diagram that you
      think would help. Do you know for sure they’re congruent?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Depending on the way you answered question #5, you may have
    an airtight proof already. Let’s write one out as an example of
    a chain of reasoning in which all the steps are justified.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/parallelogram%2021.svg" >
    </figure>

    <p>Given: $\overline {AD} \parallel \overline {BC} $ and
    $\overline {AB} \parallel \overline {DC} $.</p>

    <p>Goal: Prove that $\overline {AE} \cong \overline {EC} $ and $\overline {BE} \cong \overline {ED} $.</p>

    <p>$\angle DAE \cong \angle BCE$ because they are alternate
    interior angles of
    the parallel lines $\overline {AD} $ and $\overline {BC} $.</p>

    <p>$\angle ADE \cong \angle CBE$ for the same reason.</p>

    <p>$\overline {AD} \cong \overline {BC} $ because opposite
    sides of a parallelogram are congruent.</p>

    <p>Therefore, $\triangle AED \cong \triangle CEB$ by the
    ASA congruence theorem.</p>

    <p>$\overline {AE} \cong \overline {EC} $ because they are
    corresponding parts of congruent triangles.</p>

    <p>$\overline {BE} \cong \overline {ED} $ for the same
    reason.</p>

    <p>
    Are we done? YES! We’ve accomplished our goal, showing that the
    diagonals cut each other in half.</p>

    <p>That proof might have been written with a little more care
    than you are used to. Your class will have to decide exactly
    how much writing is expected in a proof. But notice that every
    step in the argument comes from your list of postulates, so
    that anyone who accepts the postulates can't disagree with your
    conclusion — there is no “wiggle room” in this proof.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, you should have found that it is $not$ true that
    the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect the angles. You may
    remember from last year that an example designed to show that
      something isn’t true is called a <strong>counterexample</strong>. Here’s what a
    counterexample to this statement might look like:</p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/5 diagram.tif.jpg">
    </figure>

    <p>You can see from this picture that it doesn’t look true that
    the angles are bisected, and so it isn’t worth your time to
    look for a proof.</p>

    <p>In order to start the proof that the diagonals of a
    parallelogram bisect each other, we had to know exactly what
    the word “parallelogram” meant. That’s how we knew to start
    with the statements “$\overline {AB} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}
    \left\| {{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} \overline {CD} } \right.$ and
    $\overline {AD} \parallel \overline {BC} $”. Whenever we write
    a proof, we’ll have to be very precise about what we mean by
    the objects we’re talking about. For instance, last year you
    worked with the definition of a square: a quadrilateral with
    four congruent sides and four right angles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with a definition for each shape. Then compare
      notes with your class if you haven’t already done so.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A rectangle</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A parallelogram</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A rhombus</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A trapezoid</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A kite</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A circle</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now begin a section in your notebook labeled
      “definitions,” again leaving space for you to add definitions
      as you consider new shapes. Start with the definitions you
      came up with in Problem 6.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Considering the shapes in the previous question might
        remind you of some <em>more</em> things you know to be true about
      geometry. Add them to your list of postulates and theorems
      (which should they be?), and confer again with your
      classmates.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Much as you can use congruent triangles to prove things
    about diagrams, you can also use similar triangles.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/midline theorem replacement.png" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The diagram has been marked and labeled for you.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Based on the diagram, write what is
      given.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can you remember the two things you
      showed about $\overline {DE} $ and $\overline {BC} $ last
      year? If not, try drawing this diagram with triangles of a
      few different shapes, and take some measurements in order to
      make a conjecture.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">With an eye towards proving these
      results, prove that there are similar triangles in this
      picture (The three similarity
      theorems are AA, SSS, and SAS). What is the scale factor?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Finish proving what you wrote in
      part b about $\overline {BC} $ and $\overline {DE} $.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You’ve proven a couple of new things so far in this lesson.
    The interesting thing is, not only do you know those things,
    but you have proofs of them. Write the new things you know
    under the column labeled “theorems” on your list. Whenever you
    prove something new that you think may come in handy later, or
    that you just think is interesting or important, add it to this
    theorem list.</p>

    <p>By the way, is there anything under “postulates” that you
    could prove and make a theorem?</p>

      turn the burner on, and wait 20 minutes.” “All right,” you
      say, but what if the pot is already sitting on the burner,

    <h2>Going Further:
    Longer Proofs; Pitfalls When Writing Proofs</h2>

    <p>Sometimes the only way you can see that a statement must be
    true is to talk yourself through a series of steps in
    proof-like form. It would be hard to come to know the statement
    to be proven below, in any other way. In addition, the
    statement’s proof deals with some complications that you will
    sometimes come across.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/demo proof replacement.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>Given: $\overline {XQ} {\kern 1pt} \cong \overline {XU} $ and$\angle XQY \cong \angle XUZ$.<br>
    Prove:$\angle UZY \cong \angle QYZ$.</p>

    <p>“Working backwards and forwards” will be very important in
    the planning stages of this proof. At first glance, it seems
    that we should try to prove triangles $QYZ$ and $UZY$ congruent, since those are the triangles that contain the two
    angles we want to prove congruent.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find as much evidence as you can that $\triangle QYZ \cong \triangle UZY$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the previous problem you should have found a (shared)
    side and an angle, which by themselves are not enough to prove
    the triangles congruent. So we need to find another strategy.
    It may be that, using some other pair of congruent triangles in
    the figure, we can find that third piece of information
    needed
    to prove $\triangle QYZ \cong \triangle UZY$. Or, perhaps the solution is something completely
    different. Instead of doing all of our planning backwards,
    let’s return to thinking forwards and just look for any pair of
    triangles that might be congruent.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Name some other pairs of triangles that might be congruent
      in the figure. Try to find enough evidence for their
      congruence.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The triangles that we can actually prove congruent may have
    been hard to spot. As a hint, they share angle $X$. If you
    haven’t already, prove that these two
    triangles are congruent.</p>

    <p>Now that we have congruent triangles, we can mark all of
    their sides and angles congruent, as follows:</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/demo proof continuation replacement.png" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now we can return to the question of how to prove$\angle
      UZY \cong \angle QYZ$. Using the information we’ve derived,
      argue that these angles are congruent.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One way to complete the proof is to notice that, since we
    now know $\triangle XYZ$
    is isosceles,$\angle XZY \cong \angle XYZ$. Since these
    angles are both composed of two parts, and the parts $\angle
    XZU$ and$\angle XYQ$ are congruent to each other, that means
    the remaining parts must be equal as well. In other words,
    $\angle UZY \cong \angle QYZ$! Though this kind of
    part/whole reasoning doesn’t appeal to theorems or
    postulates that are most likely on your list, it is a common
    type of geometrical reasoning. Your class can decide what kind
    of language it wants to use for these types of arguments.</p>

    <p>After all that, we have used congruent triangles to figure
    out why $\angle UZY \cong \angle QYZ$. However, much of the
    argument was probably done
    orally, in combination with a marked-up diagram. It is now time
    to</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write a formal proof of the fact that $\angle UZY \cong
      \angle QYZ$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the proof you just wrote, you took pains to make sure
    that each statement was correctly justified. However, it is
    easy to be sloppy when writing proofs. Two examples of proofs
    follow that illustrate some mistakes that are easy to make.</p>

    <p>Consider the proof below showing that, if a quadrilateral
    has two pairs of
    congruent, opposite angles, then the quadrilateral is a
    parallelogram.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
    <p>First, draw a quadrilateral that can stand for any
    quadrilateral with
    congruent, opposite angles. Label the vertices $ABCD$, where
    $\angle A \cong \angle C$ and $\angle B \cong \angle D$.</p>

    <p>Given: Quadrilateral ABCD, $\angle A \cong \angle C$,
    $\angle B \cong \angle D$.</p>

    <p>Prove: $\overline {AB} \parallel \overline {CD} $, $\overline {BC} \parallel \overline {AD} $.</p>

    <p>Draw the diagonal $\overline {AC} $.</p>

<p>    $\angle B \cong \angle D$, as given.</p>

    <p>$\overline {AB} \cong \overline {CD} $ and $\overline
    {BC} \cong \overline {AD} $, because opposite sides of a
    parallelogram are congruent.</p>

    <p>Therefore, $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle CDA$ by the SAS congruence theorem.</p>

    <p>Then $\angle DAC \cong \angle BCA$ since they are
    corresponding parts of congruent triangles.</p>

    <p>That makes $\overline {BC} \parallel \overline {AD} $ since alternate interior angles are
    congruent.</p>

    <p>Similarly, $\angle BAC \cong \angle DCA$, again since
    they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles.</p>

    <p>So $\overline {AB} \parallel \overline {CD} $.</p>

    <p>Therefore, $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.</p>

      <p>This proof may seem to work quite well. However, it

    <p>Finally, here is an example of a proof that just can’t be
    right: if a triangle is

    isosceles triangles
    that are not equilateral, so you know that this proof must
    contain a mistake! The challenge is to find out what that
    mistake is. Remember that, if you agree with every step of a

    <p>Given: $\triangle ABC$ with $\overline {AB} \cong \overline {AC} $.</p>

    <p>Draw the median from $C$ and label the point where it hits

    <p>$\overline {AD} \cong \overline {DB} $ because $\overline

    <p>Also, $\angle CDA \cong \angle CDB$ because, as a median,
    $\overline {CD} $ splits $\overline {AB} $ into two right

    <p>$\overline {CD} \cong \overline {CD} $ because any line

    <p>Therefore, by SAS congruence, $\triangle CAD \cong \triangle CBD$.</p>

      <p>Which of the following proofs are “airtight”?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Prove that, in a quadrilateral, if
      a pair of opposite sides
      is both congruent and parallel, then the quadrilateral is a
        parallelogram.<br><br>

      Proof: Draw segments $\overline {AB} $ and $\overline {CD}
      $ so as to be congruent and parallel. Connect points A and
      C. Then connect points B and D. Because $\overline {AB} $ and $\overline {CD} $ are congruent and parallel,
      the line segments $\overline {AC} $ and $\overline {BD} $ have to slope in the
      same direction. Therefore, $\overline{AC} \parallel \overline{BD}$, and so ABCD is a
      parallelogram.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Prove that the diagonals of a
      rhombus bisect each other.<br><br>

      Proof: We’ve already proven, and put on our theorem list,
      that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. A
      rhombus is a type of parallelogram. Therefore, any
      statement
      that applies to a parallelogram also applies to a rhombus,
      and so the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Prove that the diagonals of a
      parallelogram bisect each other. (We’ve already proved this,
      but here is an alternate version of a proof.)<br><br>

      Proof: Draw parallelogram $ABCD$, and add diagonals that
      cross at E. We’re going to show that triangles $AED$ and
      $CEB$ are congruent. The two pairs of angles needed for
      congruence are $\angle DAE \cong \angle ACB$ and $\angle
      ADB \cong \angle DBC$.
      Those pairs really are congruent because they are both pairs
      of alternate interior angles created by parallel lines and a
      transversal. Also, sides $\overline {AD} $ and $\overline
      {BC} $ are congruent because they are opposite sides of a
      parallelogram. So now we have enough to show triangles $AED$ and $CEB$ are congruent, by ASA. Therefore, the diagonals do
      bisect each other: $\overline {DE} \cong \overline {EB} $ and $\overline {AE} \cong \overline {EC} $ as they are
      corresponding parts of congruent triangles.</p>
