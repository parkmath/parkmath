    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you define parallel lines? How would you decide
        if two lines were parallel?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Euclid, Ancient Greek geometer $extraordinaire$, defined
      parallel lines as lines in a plane which never meet, even
      when extended indefinitely. Line segments are parallel
      if they lie on parallel lines.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50"><img src="../images/02-3-geometry-of-lines/9-2-3 diagram 1.tif.jpg"
      alt="">
    </figure>

    <p>It was hard for those Greeks to determine if lines were parallel
      — after all, how could you show <em>for sure</em> that
      lines never met? What if you thought that lines were parallel,
      but actually they met at a point 100 miles away? This would
      happen if lines were very close to being parallel, but
      not quite.</p>

    <p>Euclid’s parallel lines remain the same distance apart, no
      matter where you take the measurements. (Think of train
      tracks with crossbars of equal length.) That might give
      a more practical way to tell if two lines are parallel
      — measure their distance apart in two different places
      and see if you get the same thing. But even that would
      not be without its problems. Your measuring instruments
      might not be accurate enough to tell if lines are just
      skewed enough to meet 100 miles away.</p>

    <p>To illustrate how difficult it can be to tell even if two
      short line segments are parallel, look at the following
      pair, below.
    </p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-3-geometry-of-lines/image21.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>In fact, the line segments above were drawn so as NOT to
      be parallel to one another. They are just slightly off.</p>

    <p>In the 1600s, the French mathematician and philosopher Rene
      Descartes changed the way people thought about — and did
      — geometry. The story goes that he was lying in bed one
      day, staring at the ceiling, and realized that he could
      describe the position of a bug on his ceiling by counting
      the number of ceiling cracks up and the number of ceiling
      cracks over.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you had two line segments on a $grid$, as below, and
        knew the coordinates of a few points on each line, would
        you now have a method to decide if they were parallel?</p>
      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/02-3-geometry-of-lines/image31.PNG" >
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Descartes’s wonderful idea allowed someone to take a geometric
      shape — a line — and describe its position exactly by overlaying
      a grid — a coordinate system. Since these coordinates had
      numbers attached, all of the sudden people were able to
      apply much of what they already knew about algebra to geometry.
      Descartes had allowed people to use multiple points of
      view when considering geometry problems, switching freely
      back and forth between an algebraic perspective and a geometric
      perspective. And, when you thought about the previous problem,
      so did you.</p>

    <p>The rest is history.</p>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development</h2>

    <p>Say you live in a city where the streets are laid out in
      a square grid pattern. You start at your house and walk
      two blocks north, then three blocks east.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw a picture of this path on a piece of graph paper.
        What’s the slope of the line segment connecting your
        house and your ending point? How would you describe its
        direction?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your friend lives two blocks south of you. She starts at
        her house, then follows the same pattern as you — two
        blocks north and three blocks east.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Draw a picture of your friend’s path, on the same paper
        as yours.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is there a sense in which your path and your friend’s
        paths are “parallel” (even though neither of you went
        in a straight line)? Explain this.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw the points $\left( {1,2} \right)$ and $\left( {2,5}
        \right)$. Draw the line through them — this is line $m$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Line $n$ contains the point $\left( {3,1} \right)$ and
        is parallel to line $m$. Draw line $n$. The point $\left(
        {5,c} \right)$ is on line $n$. Find $c$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What are the slopes of lines $m$ and $n$?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Discuss this question with a partner: Suppose that you
        have two lines, one with slope 5 and another with slope
        $\tfrac{11}{2}$. Will they have to meet somewhere? Try
        drawing several pairs of lines with these slopes. What
        keeps happening?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Based on your thinking in the previous problems, say what
        must be true for two lines to be parallel.</p>
    </div>

    <p>What about lines that are perpendicular to each other — that
      is, lines that cross at a 90 degree angle?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Can two lines, each with positive slope, be perpendicular?
        How about two lines, each with a negative slope? Explain
        with a picture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw the line $y = 2x$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is $y = - 2x$ perpendicular to this line? How about $y
        = \frac{1}{2}x$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Take some guesses at the equation for a line that really
        might be perpendicular to the line $y = 2x$. Check your
        guesses by drawing this line on the same coordinate system.</p>
    </div>

    <p>We found that parallel lines have the same slopes. Do the
      slopes of perpendicular lines also have some relationship?
      Instead of trying to find a general rule right away, let’s
      simplify the problem by making up an example.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using graph paper, draw a line segment (not horizontal
        or vertical), and use a measuring tool (a protractor?
        the corner of a piece of paper?) to draw another line
        segment perpendicular to the first. Then calculate the
        slopes of the two segments you drew. What do you suppose
        would be more helpful in looking for patterns — writing
        the slopes in fraction or decimal form?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>By creating other examples, or by looking at the results
        of the examples your classmates made up, conjecture a
        relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Try out your conjecture by using it to answer the following
        questions. Suppose that lines $p$ and $q$ are perpendicular.
      </p>

      <p class="problem-part">What’s the slope of line $p$ if line $q$ has slope $\frac{3}{5}$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What’s the slope of line $p$ if the equation of line
        $q$ is $y = \frac{1}{3}x + 1$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What’s the slope of line $p$ if the equation of line
        $q$ is $y = - 2x + 1$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Check your answers to the previous problem by graphing
        lines that fit the conditions of parts a, b, and c. Now
        do you think your conjecture is true? If not, use this
        new information to change your conjecture.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">We’ve already found a way, using slope, to describe the direction
      of your path through a city. We can also use information
      about evenly-spaced city blocks to calculate your distance.
    </p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Starting at your house, you walk 2 miles west and 6 miles
        north. How far away are you now from your house (measuring
        distance along a straight path)?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your house is at the point $\left( {1,5} \right)$. You
        walk to the point $\left( {10,4} \right)$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How far east or west did you go?
      </p>

      <p class="problem-part">How far north or south did you go?
      </p>

      <p class="problem-part">What’s your distance from your house?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw the points $\left( { - 2,3} \right)$ and $\left( {2,6}
        \right)$. Find the distance between them.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Finally, you can calculate the position $halfway$ between
      two locations in a city (or on a graph). This position
      is called the <em class="vocab">midpoint</em>. We can also
      speak of the midpoint of a line segment connecting two
      points. Soon, we’ll find a formula that tells you how to
      find the midpoint of a segment joining $(x_1,y_1)$ and
      $(x_2, y_2)$. But first let’s try some simpler problems.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What would be the midpoint of $\left( {1,5} \right)$ and
        $\left( {6,10} \right)$? Create some other, simple problems
        like this where you have to find the midpoint.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What would be the midpoint of $\left( {1,0} \right)$ and
        $\left( {3,y} \right)$? Of $\left( {x,4} \right)$ and
        $\left( {3,y} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the midpoint of $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$?
      </p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write in symbols what the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of
        the midpoint would be.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Compare your answer with what other people got. If there
        are different answers, see if you can do some algebra
        to make them look the same.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You’ve probably noticed already that it can be extremely
      helpful to draw pictures in solving these problems. For
      instance, in the previous problem, you may have sketched
      the line and the approximate location of the points before
      solving for $w$ and $r$. While that wasn’t strictly necessary
      to solve the problem, it helps you to get a handle on it.

    <p>For most of the problems remaining in this lesson, you will
      probably want to draw a picture. But even in most of the
      problems above, there was work left to do after the picture
      was drawn. The facts you now know about the slopes of parallel
      and perpendicular lines give you tools to use algebra to
      solve problems, as well. Sometimes this will be required,
      as in the case where your drawing suggests that a line
      passes through a certain point, but you’ll need to try
      algebra in order to make certain that it wasn’t just close.
      In the four problems that follow, don’t forget to draw
      a picture first, but you will also find <em class="vocab">representing</em>
