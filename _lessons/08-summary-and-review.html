      <p>A person with diabetes takes a shot of 10 units of
      insulin. The amount of insulin in the bloodstream decays
      exponentially. 10 minutes later, there are 5.99 units of
      insulin left in the bloodstream.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find a formula for the number of
      units of insulin left after $t$ minutes.</p>

      bloodstream after 20 minutes?</p>
