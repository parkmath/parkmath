      <p>Andrew decides to measure the height of a tree by using an
      idea he learned in class. He takes two poles—one 10 feet long
      and the other 14 feet long—and walks up to a very tall tree.
      He places the 14-ft tall pole to the side, walks with the
      10-ft pole straight out 36 feet from the tree and plants the
      pole so that it is parallel to the tree. He then walks along
      the same line father away from the tree until the
      line-of-sight from the ground to the top of the 10-ft pole
      intersects with the top of the tree. He marks this spot on
      the ground and measures from it to the base of the 10-ft
      pole. This distance is 6 feet. He then takes the other
      pole—the 14-ft one—and walks in the opposite direction from
      the 10-ft pole until he’s 40 feet from the tree. He plants
      the 14-ft pole so that it is parallel to the tree. He then
      walks along the same line farther away from the tree until
      the line-of-sight from the ground to the top of the 14-ft
      pole lines up with the top of the tree. He marks this spot on
      the ground and measures from it to the base of the 14-ft
      pole. This distance is d feet. (You’ll notice that I’m not
      telling you what this distance is. Heh, heh, heh!) Assume the
