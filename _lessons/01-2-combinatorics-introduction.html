    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>John wishes to wear a nice pair of dress pants with a
    sport-coat when he goes out on his first date tonight. He has 5
    different pairs of dress pants and 3
    different sport-coats. John, wishing to make the best possible
    first impression, decides to try on each combination of a pair
    of dress pants and a sport-coat. After trying all of these
    combinations, he will decide which is the best. It will take
    him approximately five minutes to get dressed, look carefully
    at the jacket-pants combination, and then get undressed. If it
    is 5:30 p.m. now, and John wishes to be leaving his house by
    7:00 p.m., will he make it? It’s not hard to see that John
    should be interested in the number of jacket-pants combinations
    that he will be trying on. Determining this number is in the
    realm of an area of mathematics known as <em class="vocab">combinatorics</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many jacket-pants combinations will John have to
      try?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write down as many different ways of determining the
      answer to Problem 1 as you can think of. Compare these ways
      to the ways of other students in your class. Which method is
      most visual? Least visual?</p>
    </div>

    <p>John’s situation is one that can be reasonably solved by
    listing all of the possible combinations. This approach, while
    sufficient, is not particularly useful with the task that
    Imelda Marcos would have had. She reputedly had approximately
    3000 pairs of shoes, 2000 designer dresses, 500 bras, and 200
    girdles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many shoes-dresses combinations did Imelda have?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many shoes-dresses-bras combinations did she have?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Can you reasonably answer either Problem 3 or 4 by
      visualizing? What method(s) used to solve John’s problem can
      be used with Imelda’s?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose you were trying to determine the number of
      combinations of ${n_1}$ things combined with ${n_2}$ things
      combined with ${n_3}$ things and so on up to ${n_k}$ things.
      How many combinations are there?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The result you probably wrote in Problem 6 is known as the
    <em class="vocab">Multiplication Principle of Counting</em>.</p>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many dress and girdle combinations did Imelda
      Marcos have?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You can make a sundae at <em>I Scream</em> by choosing one scoop of
      ice cream from 6 options (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry,
      banana, cherry, or coffee), one topping from 4 options
      (hamburger crumble, pickle pieces, bacon bits, or onion O’s),
      and one sauce from 3 options (ketchup, mayonnaise, or
      balsamic). How many different sundaes do you get to choose
      from? Mmmm!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <p>John’s and Imelda’s problems led to our first significant
    idea in combinatorics. If this was all there were to
    combinatorics, however, the subject would not be of much
    interest to mathematicians, computer scientists, or businesses,
    nor would this lesson have more pages in it (as you can plainly
    see that it does). Let’s look at some different situations from
    what we saw before.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The members of the Math Society wish to appoint a slate of
      officers that will be in charge of its meetings and
      activities this year. The slate will have 2 positions —
      President and Secretary. If there are 5 students in the Math
      Society, how many distinct slates can be formed? By distinct
      we mean to distinguish the slate consisting of Sheila
      (President)
      and Jack (Secretary) from the slate consisting of Jack
      (President) and Sheila (Secretary). You might think about
      visualizing in order to get a handle on how to count in this
      situation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose that the slate had 3 positions — President,
      Secretary, and Treasurer — and there were 6 students in the
      Math Society. How many distinct slates can be formed now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose that the Math Society expanded to 25 students and,
      therefore, decided that the governing body should have
      4 positions — President, Vice-President, Secretary, and
      Treasurer. How many distinct slates can be formed now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In how many different ways can Elsa arrange 5 books on
      the top shelf of her bookcase? She’s going to arrange them
      side-by-side and standing up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In how many different ways can Elsa arrange 20 books on
      the top shelf of her bookcase? Show your work.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Your response to determining the exact amount in Problem 13
    might be to scream as you realize that you will have to
    write</p>

    <p>$20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17 \cdot 16 \cdot 15 \cdot 14
    \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7
    \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1.$</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Christian Kramp in 1808 showed some foresight
    and decided to
    co-opt the exclamation mark for just this situation. Given the
    above problem, Christian would have written $20!$. (“$20!$” is read as “20 factorial.”)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write $9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3
      \cdot 2 \cdot 1$ using factorial notation. Write $6!$ without
      factorial notation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose we are going to create a 7-letter “word” by using
      the letters in the word “numbers”. The “word” doesn’t have to
      make sense.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many different 7-letter words
      can we create if a letter cannot be used more than once in a
      word? Can you write your answer using factorial notation?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many different 7-letter words
      can we create if a letter can be used more than once in a
      word? Can you write your answer using factorial notation?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the probability that a
      random 7-letter word created from the letters from “numbers”,
      where each of the letters could be used more than once, also
      happens to be a 7-letter word that uses each of the letters
      in “numbers” exactly once?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Problem 15 Part a could have been written using different,
    but equivalent, language. A common way of expressing this
    problem is to ask, “How many different 7-letter words can we
    create if repetition is not allowed?” The phrase “repetition is
    not allowed” means in this case that a letter cannot be used
    more than once in a word. Problem 15 Part b, similarly, could
    have been written, “How many different 7-letter words can we
    create if repetition is allowed?” Paying
    attention to whether repetition is allowed is critical when
    trying to understand what
    you are trying to count. In other words, you need to develop
    the habit of <em class="vocab">re-examine the problem</em> if you’re going to avoid
    undercounting or overcounting.</p>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many four-letter “words” can be made from the letters
      A, B, C, D, and E, if any arrangement is counted as a “word”
      and repetition is not allowed? Now consider using the
      26-letter alphabet — how many 4-letter words are possible if,
      again, repetition is not allowed?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many distinct license plates can be created in a state
      that has a 6-digit license plate (that is, plates have 6
      digits and no letters) where digits can repeat? How many more
      license plates would there be if a 7th digit was added?</p>

      different cuts, how many different key configurations are
      possible?</p>

      secretary. If there are 5 people running for president, 4 for
      vice-president, 4 for treasurer, and 3 for secretary, how
      many distinct, complete ballots could be filled out?</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    
    <p>In each problem you should think very carefully about the
    information that’s been presented in order to determine what is
    relevant in solving the problem. Furthermore, you should
    consider
    visualizing — not necessarily with a tree diagram, but with
    slots or boxes — as a way of trying to organize the
    information. Lastly, if the numbers in the problem are large,
    don’t be afraid to change them to smaller numbers and,
    therefore, make the problem a little easier to work with
    initially. By doing this, you are using or developing an
    important habit called <em class="vocab">change or simplify the problem.</em></p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Three-digit area codes on phones were introduced after it
      became clear that the
      restrictions on the seven-digit phone number
      limited the number of phones that could be in use. The
      original restrictions on these three-digit codes were as
      follows: the first digit can only be a digit from 2-9; the
      second digit must be 0 or 1; and the last can be any
      digit.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many area codes were
      possible?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many area codes began with the
      digit 4?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the probability that a

      <p>In the United States, radio and television stations all
      have three- or four-letter “call signs” that begin with
      either K or W.
      Stations east of the Mississippi River
      start with W, and stations west of the
      Mississippi start with K.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">In 1928 there were 677 radio
      stations (and 0 television stations) in the United States. If
      repetition of letters were allowed (so a station could be
      called WOW, for example), would it have been possible for
      each of these stations to have a three-letter call sign?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Today, using three- or four-letter
      call signs, how many TV or radio stations total could exist
      east of the Mississippi if repetition of letters were not
      allowed?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Of all the possible 3-letter call
      signs, what is the probability that if you randomly choose
      one it will have all of its letters in common with the
      station WJZ? For example: WJJ or WWZ.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Of all the possible 4-letter
      call
      signs, what is the probability that if you randomly choose
      one it will
      have exactly three of its letters in common with WTMD? (For
      example:
