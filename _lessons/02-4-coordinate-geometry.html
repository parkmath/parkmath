    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In the previous lesson, you learned about parallel and
    perpendicular lines. A pair of lines that are parallel never
    meet; other pairs of lines that you can draw on paper
    eventually will. You also learned that you can tell if lines
    are parallel by checking their slopes.

    The lines below aren’t on a coordinate system, so you won’t be
    able to check their slopes. However, to prove that they are not
    parallel, you could extend them to a point where they meet.</p>

    <p>Place an extra piece of paper next to the picture above.
    Then, using a straightedge, pick two non-parallel lines and
    extend them until they finally meet. How far away from the edge
    of the picture did they meet?</p>

    <p>Will the real square please stand up? One of these figures
    is a square. The other is an impostor.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find a way to determine which one is the square. Keep in
      mind that measuring with a ruler will not be accurate
      enough.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here’s another figure which really is a square:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/02-4-coordinate-geometry/or%20is%20it%20a%20real%20square.pdf.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p>Or is it? As you have seen, it can be hard to tell.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What would you have to check to $prove$ that this is
      indeed a square? Do so.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the previous problem, it wasn’t enough just to show
      that all the sides were the same length. Can you draw some
      four-sided figures, other than squares, where the sides are
      all the same length? Do you remember what such figures are
      called?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Similarly, it wasn’t enough to show that all of the angles
      were 90 degrees. Draw some four-sided figures other than
      squares with four 90-degree angles. What are they called?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Appearances can be deceiving. When confronted with a
    diagram, you should never assume what is not explicitly stated.
    You can’t be sure that you really have parallel lines, segments
    of the same length, etc. That is, you can’t be sure unless you
    prove it!</p>

    <p>For example, a square is defined as a quadrilateral with
    four equal sides and four 90-degree angles. So to prove that
    something is a square, you need to: 1) Check that it has four
    sides, 2) Show that the sides have the same length (using the
    distance formula, for example), and 3) Show that all angles are
    90 degrees (by comparing slopes, for example).</p>

    <p>To prove that something is not a square, you only need to
    show that it fails on at least one of the counts above. So, for
    example, if you used the distance formula to show that two
    sides of a figure were of two different lengths, you would have
    already proved that it is not a square — no need to check the
    other criteria.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use the definition of a square to do the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Prove that the four-sided shape
      with vertices on $\left( {3,0} \right)$, $\left( {7,3}
      \right)$, $\left( {4,7} \right)$, and $\left( {0,4}
      \right)$ is a square.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Make up your own square, then
      construct an argument to prove to someone else that it is a
      square.</p>

      are not.</p>

    <h2 style="page-break-before: always;">Going Further</h2>

    <p>Could we prove that the diagonals of $any$ rectangle are the
    same length as each other? One thing we could do would be to
    try another example. Let’s take another rectangle of a
    different size, say the one defined by $\left( {3,4} \right)$,
    $\left( {9,7} \right)$, $\left( {8,9} \right)$, and $\left(
    {2,6} \right)$. Using the distance formula, we find that the
    lengths of the diagonals are $\sqrt {{{(9 - 2)}^2} + {{(7 -
    6)}^2}} $ and $\sqrt {{{(8 - 3)}^2} + {{(9 - 4)}^2}} $,
    which both simplify to $\sqrt {50} $.</p>

    <p>Are we better off than we were before? Now we know that our
    conjecture is true for two rectangles, but that still leaves
    lots of other rectangles we’re not sure about. Another strategy
    might be to draw a rectangle that could represent any
    rectangle. To make life easiest, let’s position it so that its
    bottom edge lines up with the $x$-axis, with its left side
    touching the origin.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/02-4-coordinate-geometry/generic%20rectangle.svg" >
    </figure>

    <p>We don’t want to say how long the sides are, because then
    we’d have a specific rectangle. So let’s just call the lengths
    a and b.</p>

    <p>Notice that the coordinates of the point in the rectangle’s
    upper right corner have been left blank. We could be lazy and
    fill them in with two more letters: $\left( {c,d} \right)$.
    But there is a way to do it in terms of the other letters that
    are already in the diagram.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Read the previous paragraph (if you haven’t already) and
      find a better way to name the coordinates of the point in the
      upper right corner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now use the distance formula to find the length of each
      diagonal of this rectangle. Note that your answers will have
      letters in them that won’t go away! How do your answers
      compare? What did you just prove?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Using symbols to represent numbers or coordinates that could
    take on any values is another example of <em class="vocab">representing
      symbolically</em>. In addition to allowing us to do the proof,
    representing the coordinates symbolically has a side benefit
    here: any calculations we do using these symbols will apply to
    any rectangle we could possibly come across.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use the formula you found in Problem 18 to find the
      lengths of the two diagonals of a 17x42 rectangle. Does your
      formula work?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Socrates read your work in Problem 18, and complained that
      you’ve really only shown that the diagonals are congruent for
      rectangles that have a corner at $\left( {0,0} \right)$ and
      are sitting flat on the $x$-axis. Is he right? Do you have a
      response?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw a square that can represent any square, placing it on
      a grid and labeling the coordinates of its important points
      with letters (as you did in Problem 17). You may want to make
      one of its corners the origin. Now calculate the length of
      the diagonals of your square.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw an isosceles triangle than can represent any
      isosceles triangle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find two different sensible ways to

      <p class="problem-part">Find the coordinates of the

      triangle.</p>

      <p>Part b of the previous problem is a proof of a theorem.

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now rotate your isosceles triangle of Problem 22 so that
      the base side (the side that is a different length from the

      triangles like these, as well?</p>
    </div>

    <p>You’ve now had a bit of practice doing proofs that aren’t
    just about specific diagrams. For example, you proved that the
    diagonals in ANY rectangle are the same length.</p>

    <p>Of course, some statements you’ll investigate in geometry
    may turn out to be false. When you’re asked to prove something,
    it’s a good idea to figure out if it’s worth it to even begin
    the proof — maybe the statement wasn’t true to begin with.</p>

    <div class="problem">

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>
      Whenever you test a statement in geometry to see if it’s
      true, you should <em class="vocab">visualize</em> by
      drawing several, varied pictures of the shape you’re investigating.
      If you can’t find a counterexample and the statement appears
      to be true, it’s time to look for a proof. But it is never
      good enough to prove something by doing the calculations
      on a specific shape you drew. You’ll have to <em class="vocab">represent</em>
      the coordinates <em class="vocab">symbolically</em> by

      vertices of a rhombus. Find values for $b$, $c$, and $d$. Then find
      at least one other set of values for $b$, $c$, and $d$ that work
      (draw a picture).</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here is a circle, with a line drawn tangent to it — the
      line hits the circle in exactly one place. The radius of the
      circle is also shown. What angle do the tangent and radius
      appear to form? Prove that they do indeed form this
      angle.</p>

      <p>Two vertices of triangle $ABC$ are located at $A\left(
      {2,7} \right)$ and $B\left( {-4, 5} \right)$ and the area of the triangle is 8 square
      units. Write an equation that describes the position of the

      <p>There is something funny about the pair of pictures on the
      next page.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Calculate the area of each piece
      making up the two shapes below. Do the pieces stay consistent
      in size from the first picture to the second?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add up the areas of the four pieces
      making up the shape at the top. This should be the area of
      the top shape. Then add up the areas of the four pieces
      making up the shape at the bottom. What does this show about
      the areas of the top and bottom shapes?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Take another look at the top and
      bottom shapes. Does it make sense that they would have the
      same area?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Tinker! There’s more you can
      calculate in this picture besides just the areas of the
      various shapes. Get more data and see if you can use it to
      explain this optical illusion!</p>
