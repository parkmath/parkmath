    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content"><p>In a roomful of businesspeople, everyone
        wants to network with the others in the room. To achieve this, each
        person shakes hands with every other person in the room. If there are $n$
        people in the room, then, in terms of $n$, how many handshakes will
        occur?</p>
      </div> 
    </div>

    <p>When you solved this problem, you may have used the strategy
    of change or simplify the problem, trying
    the problem with four or five businesspeople
    and noticing the pattern. However you solved it, in order to
    generalize to $n$ people, you had to describe, if only to
    yourself, a process by which you could count the number of
    handshakes. If you discussed this problem in class, you
    probably found yourself having to put this process into words
    very clearly, so that someone else following your process would
    also arrive at the correct answer: $n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ...
    + 1$.</p>

    <p>In mathematics, taking the time to describe something — a
    procedure, a set of data, an image, or a definition — can give
    you a deeper insight into the nature of the problem. The focus
    in this lesson
    will first be on writing thorough descriptions. In later
    problems, you will find that coming up with
    a complete description of a method for tackling
    the problem will be of use in solving it and other
    problems like it — as was the case with Problem 1.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content"><p>Without looking up what a pentagon is, explain to a 5th      grader how      to tell if a shape is a pentagon. Remember that it might not      even be      a polygon. You can assume, however, that the shape is      something      that can be drawn with pencil and paper.</p></div>
    </div>

  </section>
  <section class="problems">
    <p>When you describe something, in order for your description
    to be as insightful as possible, you should have the following
    goals in mind:</p>

    <p>Your description should be <em>complete</em>, addressing all
    possibilities that could arise. In the problem above, did you
    take into account the fact that the shape might have curved
    lines? That it might have lines intersecting each other? Or
    even multiple lines intersecting at the same point as in the
    letter “K”.</p>

    <p>Your description should be <em>understandable</em> (to the
    intended reader). For example, you would be correct
    if you gave Wikipedia’s definition of a pentagon, “a
    five-sided polygon,” but this doesn’t do any good if the fifth
    grader doesn’t know what a polygon is.</p>

    <p>Your description should be <em>unambiguous</em>. This means that your
    description should be completely clear, and not open to any
    different interpretations. You should ask yourself, “Would it
    be possible for the reader to read my description carefully,
    but misunderstand what I mean?” For example, if you said “a
    pentagon must have five sides,” would someone reading the
    description think that this meant “exactly five sides” or “at
    least five sides”? If you think there is any possibility that
    your language might be misinterpreted, you should be more
    specific.</p>

    <p>Try this next exercise to practice writing a thorough
    description:</p>

    <div class="problem">Describe how to
      draw a lowercase letter “r”, to someone who’s never seen our
      alphabet. Once your description is complete, go on to the next
      problem.</div>

    <div class="problem">The shapes below
      are some possible ways that the reader could draw an “r”
      incorrectly – make sure your description from the previous
      problem is clear enough that none of these mistakes could
      occur, and edit it if necessary.

    </div>
    

    <div class="problem">How would you
      explain what speed is to someone who doesn’t understand the
      phrase “how fast you’re going”?</div>

    <p>If you thought that the task of describing how to draw an r
    was a little bit silly, you’re right. Everyone in your class
    knows how to draw an r, and children who don’t know how to make
    an r are taught by example, not by description. Likewise, the
    chances are slim of your running into someone without a
    layperson’s understanding of speed.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the task of providing a basic description
    can be illuminating in its own right. It’s easy to believe that
    you understand what speed is, but when encouraged to define it
    for someone who doesn’t understand certain phrases, you’re
    likely to think more carefully about what speed actually is and
    therefore be able to use this understanding in future problems
    dealing with speed. Providing a careful description of
    something often helps you to understand it, bringing
    assumptions to light and revealing questions that you may not
    have known you had.</p>

    <p>With a few exceptions, the next batch of problems does not
    require you to pretend you have an audience with gaping holes
    in their knowledge. Instead, the problems are opportunities for
    you to practice writing complete, understandable, unambiguous
    descriptions targeted at people with a mathematics background
    similar to your own. In Problems 9 and 10 in particular,
    working towards a description that covers all the cases will
    guide your investigation.</p>

    <p>Targeting your explanations toward an audience of your peers
    will give you the chance to practice another virtue: making
    your descriptions <em>concise</em>. Charged with writing a complete
    description, people sometimes respond by using as many words as
    possible. But a beautiful description is thorough while at the
    same time using as few words as possible. Keep that in mind
    while working on the following problems.</p>

    <div class="problem">Last year you
      learned to solve a system
      of equations such as<br>
      $2x - 4y = 15$<br>
      $- 2x + 8y = - 1$<br>
      by adding the equations to each other in order to create a
      simpler equation that we could solve. Explain why we can solve
      the original system of equations by using this new, simpler
      equation in place of this system.</div>

    <div class="problem">In the standard
      window of your calculator
      to graph $y = \frac{{\left( {x + 2} \right)\left( {x + 3}
      \right)}}{{x + 3}}$. In the ZOOM menu choose the ZDecimal
      option. With this option, your calculator
      will set up a window where ${\rm{Xmin}} = - 4.7$,
      ${\rm{Xmax}} = 4.7$, ${\rm{Ymin}} = - 3.1$, and ${\rm{Ymax}}
      = 3.1$. Now, describe the graph of the equation and explain
      why it is this way.</div>

    <div class="problem">You learned in the
      Combinatorics lesson that the number of ways four people can
      stand in a line is 4x3x2x1=24. Describe a procedure they could
      use for systematically standing in all 24 configurations,
      without repeating any configuration.</div>

    <div class="problem">You may remember
      that the absolute value function $|x|$ takes an number x and
      makes it positive… so $|3| = 3$ and $| - 3| = 3$.

    <p class="problem-part">a. Make a table of values, then use it to graph the equation
    $y = |x|$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">b. Make a table of values, then use it to graph the equation
    $y = |x - 3|$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">c. Describe the graph of $y = |x - h|$ clearly enough that,
    once you tell someone a specific value of h, they could draw
    the graph accurately.</p></div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>An equation of the form $y = {x^n}$ is called a power
      function. $y = {x^2}$ and $y = {x^3}$ are two simple
      examples, with $n = 2$ and $n = 3$. Use your calculator to
      graph some different power functions, making sure you have
      chosen a sensible window. Describe the effect of the
      different values of $n$ on the graph. Make sure you try values
      of $n$ that are negative, fractional, etc. Try to categorize
      all the different types of graphs you can get depending on
      what $n$ is.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Describe a circle to someone who’s never seen anything
      circular. You can either explain how to draw one, or define
      what it is.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Do this problem with a partner. First, draw a meaningless
      shape on a piece of paper — just doodle for a few seconds,
      and make it look fairly random, but not too complicated.
      Don’t let your partner see the shape.</p>

      <p>Then, your partner should get a pen and paper, and you should
      describe what your shape looks like and have them try to draw
      it. Don’t look at what they’re drawing or make any gestures —
      just tell them what to do in words. At the end, look to see
      how accurately it turned out.</p>

<p>      You should each be the “describer” twice. Try to make your
      second try more accurate based on what you learned from your
      first try.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are even more benefits to providing a clear
    description! Not only can it help you convince others that your
    solution is correct, a clear, complete description can help you
    be sure that you haven’t overlooked anything in your solution
    to the problem. In addition, by doing problems such as the
    average speed or the four-people-in-a-line problem, you might
    have learned something deep about the nature of the concepts
    involved. Finally, you may find that, in providing a complete
    description of your solution to one problem, you may see a way
    to apply the solution to another problem.</p>

    <p>In the final set of problems, the description will no longer
    be the task itself. Each of these problems requires you to come
    up with a clear solution method. The trick will be to come up
    with a plan for solving each problem, after which the solution
    becomes much easier. As you work the problems, imagine
    explaining your solution method to your classmates. This will
    not only help you be ready to convince your classmates that
    your solution works, it will make sure that you are really
    honest about following your method.</p>

    <p>Don’t forget: after initially tinkering to get a feel for
    the problem, ask yourself, “what’s my plan?”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A merchant visited three state fairs. At the first, she
      doubled her money and spent \$150. At the second, she tripled
      her money and spent \$270. And, at the third, she quadrupled
      her money and spent \$360. Alexi found that she had \$240 at
      the end. How much money did she start with? Is there another
      solution?</p>

      <p>Rihanna decides to give her three friends — Alicia, Jason,
      and Sali — some of her nickels that she brought to school.
      She gives Alicia half of her nickels plus one half of a
      nickel. Then she gives Jason half of her remaining nickels,
      plus half a nickel. Finally, she gives her last remaining
      nickel to Sali. How many nickels did Rihanna bring to school?
