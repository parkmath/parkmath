    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h4>The Leaning Tower of Pisa</h4>

    <p class="Lesson---Narrative-text">The Leaning Tower of Pisa
    has been leaning almost since the onset of construction in
    1173. From ground to top, the tower is 183.27 ft along the
    lowest side and 186.02 ft along the highest side. The angle of
    slant of the tower—formed by its shorter slant height and the
    ground—is ${95.5^ \circ }$. An apocryphal tale states that
    Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), an Italian physicist,
    mathematician, and philosopher, dropped two cannon balls of
    different weights from the top of this leaning tower in trying
    to demonstrate that the descending speed of a falling body is
    independent of its weight.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>What is the distance traveled by an object dropped from the
    top of the Tower of Pisa, on its lowest side, when it hits the
    ground?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
    <p>What is the horizontal distance from the point where the
    object hits the ground to the base of the tower?</p>
    </div>
    
    <p class="new-page">The Tower of Pisa first acquired a slant after the third
    floor was built in 1178. More recently, in 1990, it was closed
    to the public because of safety fears. In fact, the tower was
    on the verge of collapse, and it was projected that it would
    have collapsed between 2030 and 2040. However, it has been
    straightened a bit, but still remains slanted (the tower has
    been reopened to the public). Thus, the angle of slant of the
    Tower of Pisa, $\alpha $, has been changing for centuries. The
    following is a sketch of the situation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>In trying to determine a general expression for the
    distance, $h$, traveled by an object dropped from the top of the
    Tower of Pisa’s lowest side when it hits the ground (assuming
    that the shorter length of the tower has not changed), Gerald
    found the following expression.</p>
      
      <div align="center"> ${h} = {183.27\sin \alpha}$ </div>
      
    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">For the horizontal
    distance from the point where the object hits the ground to the
    base of the tower, Gerald found the following expression.</p>

      <div align="center"> ${x} = {-183.27\cos \alpha}$ </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>We follow the convention of labeling the angles of a
    triangle using capital letters, and the lengths of the
    corresponding opposite sides with the corresponding lower-case
    letters. For example, we may label A, B, C the angles of the
    triangle, and a, b, c the corresponding opposite sides, as in
    the figure below.</p>

    <h4>The Bermuda Triangle</h4>

    <p>The “Bermuda Triangle” or “Devil’s Triangle” is an imaginary
    area located off the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United
    States of America, which is noted for a supposedly high
    incidence of unexplained disappearances of ships and aircraft.
    The vertices of the triangle are generally believed to be
    Bermuda, Miami (Florida), and San Juan (Puerto Rico).
    </p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/Bermuda%20Triangle.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>
    
    <p>One of the amazing stories from this triangle tells that an
    aircraft (A in the figure below) was 747.23 miles from the
    airport of Miami (M in the figure), on the line joining Miami
    and Bermuda, when its crew received an SOS signal from Cyclops
    (C in the figure), a ship located at a point on the line
    joining Miami airport and San Juan, which was sinking. Flight
    controllers at the airport were able to estimate the measure of
    $\angle AMC$ to be ${52^ \circ }$.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/diagram%204.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p>Based on the previous story, Mr. Thomas Howard designed a
    problem for his mathematics class. The initial situation
    described in the story, however, contained more than the
    minimal information required to solve the problem; therefore,
    he divided the class into two groups, Group I and Group II, and
    gave each group a problem with different pieces of information,
    but the same goal to determine how many miles the aircraft had
    to travel through the purportedly dangerous Bermuda Triangle
    before reaching Cyclops.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Group I: Besides the general information described above, it
    is known that $m\angle C = {60^ \circ }$. What is the distance
    between the aircraft A and the sinking ship Cyclops C? Find a
    solution to this problem and explain how you arrived at your
    answer.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
    <p>Group II: Besides the original and general information, it
    is known that the distance from Cyclops to the airport of Miami
    is 800 miles, as shown in the figure below. What is the
    distance between the aircraft A and the sinking ship Cyclops C?
    Find a solution to this problem and explain how you arrived at
    your answer.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>In Problem 5, if the distance given were m and the one to be
    found were c, the problem could be solved in a similar way.
    Consider the more general triangle below.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">

    <p class="problem-part">Draw the altitude from A to side
    $\overline {MC} $, and prove that ${\dfrac {c} {\sin C}} = {\dfrac {m} {\sin M}} \;$. </p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Hint: If $h$ is the length
    of the altitude from A to $\overline {MC} $, find h in $\Delta {ADM}$ in
    terms of $c$ and $\angle M$. Then find $\sin C$ in $\Delta {ADC}$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Now, prove that ${\dfrac {m} {\sin M}} = {\dfrac {a} {\sin A}} \;$</p>
    </div>
    
    <p class="new-page">In group II, Rebecca noticed that if the measure of $\angle
    M$ were ${90^ \circ }$ rather than ${52^ \circ }$, the
    Pythagorean Theorem would guarantee that ${m^2} = {a^2} +
    {c^2}$. “However,” she said, “since $\angle M$ is less than
    ${90^ \circ }$, the Pythagorean relationship among $m$, $a$, and $c$
    must be adjusted.” This adjustment is the result that you are
    about to find in Part c of the following problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Consider the triangle in Mr. Howard’s problem in a more
    general form, as shown below, and prove the following.</p>

    <p>In part c of the previous problem, expand the square on

    </div>
    
    <p>As announced above, the expression relating $m$ with $c$, $a$, and
    $\angle M$ that you may have found in the previous problem is
    the adjustment to the Pythagorean relationship ${m^2} = {a^2} +
    {c^2}$ required when $m\angle M &lt; {90^ \circ }$. In a
    similar way, adjustments to the Pythagorean relationship
    relating $a$ to $m$ and $c$ as well as to that relating $c$ to $a$ and $m$
    may be needed when either $m\angle A$ or $m\angle C$ is not
    ${90^ \circ }$, as in the case illustrated above.</p>

    <p>two sets of equalities have been found.</p>

    <p class="new-page">On the one hand, the set of equalities that you may have
      proven in Problem 7 is known as the <b>Law of Sines</b>.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the set of equalities that you may have
    found in Problems 9, 10b, and 10d is known as the <b>Law of
      Cosines</b>.</p>

    <h2>Further Development</h2>

    <p>When the students in Mr. Howard’s class shared their
    findings (the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines) the
    information contained in these laws was considered “the key” to
    find missing side lengths or angles in any triangle, when basic
    information about the triangle is known. However, in reality in
    all the proofs only acute triangles—triangles with each of
    their three angles being less than ${90^ \circ }$—were
    used.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Regarding Mr. Howard’s problem, consider the following
    situation where $m\angle M = {142^ \circ }$.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/image52.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Does the proof of the Law
    of Sines (in Problem 7), or that of the Law of Cosines (in
    Problems 8 and 9), support the use of either of these laws to
    find $m$ in this triangle, which is not an acute triangle?
    Explain.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Consider the following obtuse $\Delta {AMC}$ (that is, a triangle

      Often times, a problem that seems to be hard may be
      simplified a lot by just drawing a diagram or adding a couple
      of lines—or even just points—to a diagram already in place.
      These additions (to the concrete situation given) are
        implemented to <em class="vocab">visualize</em> and better understand problems which
      may have been initially confusing. In the following problems,
      29 through 33, you will have the chance to use this
      mathematical habit of mind repeatedly.</p>

      known. Case SSA: when two sides and the angle opposite one of
