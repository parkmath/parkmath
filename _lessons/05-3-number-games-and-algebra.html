    <h2>And Now For Something Completely Different—
    A Mindreading Textbook!</h2>

    <p>Don’t believe it? Try this!</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Pick a number, any number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 4 to it.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Square your new number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Subtract 16 from your answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Divide what you have by the
      original number you picked.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Finally, subtract the original
      number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">This textbook knows what you got as
      your answer for Part e, and in fact it predicted ahead of
      time what you were going to get. Oh, you don’t believe it?
      Check out Part g.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Why should I tell you? You think
      I’m a liar. Oh, alright, I’ll tell you, but only if you
      promise to be impressed. See part h for enlightenment.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">I’ll tell you, not that you deserve
      it. Your answer to Part e is…(drum roll please)…eight. Now
      then, kiddo, never doubt a talking textbook again.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>You may have seen a trick like the one above before and
    wondered how it worked. Let’s look at a few of them and see if
    we can figure out how they “tick”.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Have a friend pick a number without telling it to you, and
      then, keeping their calculations to themselves, ask your
      friend to:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 8 to it.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now multiply by 3.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Subtract 11.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply by 2.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 4.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Finally, have them divide by 6 and
      tell you the answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">From their answer to Part f, you
      can now figure out their original number and impress the
      socks off of them. How? Try out your solution with a
      classmate and see if it works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s figure out what happened in Problem 2 by using
      algebra. Let’s call the original number your friend was
      thinking of “$x$”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What number would they have after
      adding 8 to their
      original number?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">And after multiplying by 3?
      Remember to use parentheses!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about after subtracting 11?
      Simplify your answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">After multiplying by 2 and adding 4
      and simplifying, what expression do you have?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now divide your answer in Part d by
      6, and simplify your
      answer again. Remember that with fractions, $\frac{{a +
      b}}{c} = \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">So, given your answer in Part e,
      how can you determine your friend’s original number?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here’s a trickier one. Think of the age of anyone you
      know.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply it by 10.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 1.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply by 2.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 21.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply by 5.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Your answer to Part e will end in
      the two digits “15”.
      Remove those last two digits to get a new number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Subtract 1 from the new number, and
      that is the age you were thinking of. Why?
      (Hint if you’re having trouble: What you did in Part f can
      also be thought of as a subtraction followed by a
      division—how so?)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here’s a more difficult variation. Pick a positive
      number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Three less than that number,
      multiplied by two more than that number is…</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now take your answer from Part a
      and add the original number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 6 more.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Take the square root. Ta da! Why
      does this work?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Figuring out Problem 5 required that you understand how to
    multiply two
    expressions together like $\left( {x - 3} \right)\left( {x + 2}
    \right)$—you use the distributive law and
    then combine “like” terms. Here, then, we get</p>

    <p>${x^2} + 2x - 3x - 6 = {x^2} - x - 6$.</p>

    <p>Recall that like terms are those that have the same power of
    x.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Take two 2-digit numbers, Betty and Crocker.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Divide Betty by Crocker. (i.e.
      $\frac{{{\rm{Betty}}}}{{{\rm{Crocker}}}}$)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Raise your answer to the 4th power,
      and then square the result. Call this “Vanilla”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now, instead, divide Crocker by
      Betty.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Cube what you got, and then cube it
      again. Call this
      “Chocolate”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply “Vanilla” times
      “Chocolate”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply your answer in Part e by
      Betty. What do you get?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Instead, divide your answer in Part
      e by Crocker, and then take the reciprocal. Now what do you
      get?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Explain the mystery of the
      universe’s existence, or at least Parts f and g.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s go back to Problem 1, the introductory problem.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Calling the original number $x$,
      represent what “happens” to the number algebraically in each
      step.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">To understand why the trick works,
      we have to simplify
      the complicated expression obtained in Part a. The first two
      steps produces ${\left( {x + 4} \right)^2}$; how can this
      expression be simplified? Check with an individual value of x
      to see if your simplification is plausible. Remember,
      ${\left( {x + 4} \right)^2} = \left( {x + 4} \right)\left( {x
      + 4} \right)$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">After the 3rd and 4th steps, you
      should have $\frac{{\left( {{x^2} + 8x} \right)}}{x}$. This
      can be simplified by factoring the numerator. Do so.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Just as $\frac{{6 \cdot 13}}{6}$ can be simplified by realizing that $\frac{6}{6} = 1$ and
      that we can thus cancel out the 6’s, leaving just 13, the
      same is true with $x$’s and $y$’s. For example, $\frac{{y\left(
      {x - 5} \right)}}{y}$ is just $x - 5$, and $\frac{{{w^5}(x +
      w)}}{{{w^5}(x + 7)}}$ is just $\frac{{(x + w)}}{{(x + 7)}}$.
      Now further simplify your answer to Part c.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">After the next and final step, you
      should now understand the “trick”! To check your
      understanding, construct a similar problem where the first
      two steps are to subtract 5 from the number and then squaring
      the result, and the final step yields the original number.
      (No square rooting allowed!!)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Even when you are dealing with two or more variables, the
    following basic
    principles still hold and can be quite handy:</p>

    <p>Combining like terms when adding or subtracting (meaning
    terms that have the same powers of the same variables)—</p>

    <p>I. $2xy - 5xy = - 3xy$</p>

    <p>II. $7{w^2}{v^4} - 5{w^2}{v^4} = 2{w^2}{v^4}$</p>

    <p>Distributing—</p>

    <p>I. $3xy\left( {2xy - 5x{y^2} + 4{x^2}y} \right) =
    6{x^2}{y^2} - 15{x^2}{y^3} + 12{x^3}{y^2}$</p>
    

    <p>II.  \begin{split} \left( {7x + 4w} \right)\left( {5{x^2}
    - 11xw} \right) & = 35{x^3} - 77{x^2}w + 20{x^2}w - 44x{w^2}\\
      &  =35{x^3} - 57{x^2}w - 44x{w^2} \end{split}</p>
    
    <p> \begin{align*} \left( {7x + 4w} \right)\left( {5{x^2}
    - 11xw} \right) & = 35{x^3} - 77{x^2}w + 20{x^2}w - 44x{w^2} \tag{II}\\
      &  =35{x^3} - 57{x^2}w - 44x{w^2} \end{align*}</p>
    
    
    <p> <ol> <li> $3xy\left( {2xy - 5x{y^2} + 4{x^2}y} \right) =
    6{x^2}{y^2} - 15{x^2}{y^3} + 12{x^3}{y^2}$ </li> 
    
    <li> <table> <tr> 
      <td>$\left( {7x + 4w} \right)\left( {5{x^2}
      - 11xw} \right)$</td>
      <td> $= 35{x^3} - 77{x^2}w + 20{x^2}w - 44x{w^2}$ </td> 
      </tr>

      </table></li> </ol></p>
    
    <p> \begin{lalign}
      \left( {7x + 4w} \right)\left( {5{x^2} - 11xw} \right) & = 35{x^3} - 77{x^2}w + 20{x^2}w - 44x{w^2} \tag{II}\\
      &  =35{x^3} - 57{x^2}w - 44x{w^2} \end{lalign}</p>
      
  <p>II.
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      $\left( {7x + 4w} \right) \left( {5{x^2}
    - 11xw} \right)$ &  = 35{x^3} - 77{x^2}w + 20{x^2}w - 44x{w^2}\\

      & =35{x^3} - 57{x^2}w - 44x{w^2}\\
    \end{tabular}
    </p>
    
   <p>\begin{equation} \left( {7x + 4w} \right)\left( {5{x^2}
    - 11xw} \right) = 35{x^3} - 77{x^2}w + 20{x^2}w - 44x{w^2}\\ <br>
      =35{x^3} - 57{x^2}w - 44x{w^2}\end{equation}</p>
    
    <p>II. $\left( {7x + 4w} \right)\left( {5{x^2}
    - 11xw} \right) = 35{x^3} - 77{x^2}w + 20{x^2}w - 44x{w^2}\\ <br>
      =35{x^3} - 57{x^2}w - 44x{w^2}$</p>

    <p>Simplifying (by Recognizing “1”) when dividing—</p>

    <p>I. $\frac{{30{x^6}{y^9}}}{{15{x^6}{y^5}}} =
    \frac{{2 \cdot 15{x^6}{y^5}{y^4}}}{{15{x^6}{y^5}}}\\ =
    \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{{15{x^6}{y^5}}}{{15{x^6}{y^5}}} \cdot
    \frac{{{y^4}}}{1}\\ = \frac{{2{y^4}}}{1}\\ = 2{y^4}
    $</p>

    <p>Finding a Common denominator and combining/separating—</p>

    <p>I. $\frac{{x{y^2}}}{3} - \frac{{x{y^2}}}{7}
    = \frac{{7x{y^2}}}{{21}} - \frac{{3x{y^2}}}{{21}}\\ =
    \frac{{4x{y^2}}}{{21}}$</p>

    <p>II. $\frac{3}{t} + \frac{{4t}}{r} =
    \frac{{3r}}{{tr}} + \frac{{4{t^2}}}{{tr}}\\ = \frac{{3r +
    4{t^2}}}{{tr}}$</p>

    <p>III. $\frac{{6{x^3}y -
    22{x^4}{y^2}}}{{2x}} = \frac{{6{x^3}y}}{{2x}} -
    \frac{{22{x^4}{y^2}}}{{2x}}\\ = 3{x^2}y - 11{x^3}{y^2}
    $</p>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Ask a friend to think of any integer and add the next
      highest integer to it. Tell him to add 13 to that result, and
      then divide by 2. Finally, he subtracts the original number
      he thought of. What will his final answer be? Why?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Have a friend select two secret numbers of their
      choosing—call them Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Have them triple Rosencrantz, and
      then add 15 to their result.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Then have them multiply
      Guildenstern by 6, and add 21
      to their answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Have them compute (Answer for Part
      a) - (Answer for

      they’ve calculated.</p>

  	  <p class="problem-part">Tell them you now know what
      Guildenstern is—because you do! Just divide the number they

      the square of the original number, and tell me the
      answer.”
      
      Jake knew that all he had to do was call
      the final result Y, use his calculator to compute $50 - \sqrt

      <p>Phil from Duluth has another calculating trick. He says
      that he can calculate $33 \cdot 27$ in his head by taking the

      square of their difference, and then dividing the answer by
      4: $\frac{{{{(33 + 27)}^2} - {{(33 - 27)}^2}}}{4}$. This is
      quicker, Phil points out, because the numbers are easier—</p>
      
      $\frac{60^2-6^2}{4} = \frac{60^2}{4} - \frac{6^2}{4} = 900 - 9$

      <p>A terminating decimal is a decimal like .3764, which ends.
      A repeating decimal is one that repeats forever, like
      .862862862... .</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How can one express any terminating
      decimal as a fraction? Show that you can do so with .3674 and
      .1864597.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">It isn’t obvious whether repeating
      decimals can be expressed as fractions or not. Still, if
      .862862862... were to be equal to a fraction, it would have
      to be close to $\frac{{862}}{{1000}}$.
      See if you can find a fraction which appears to do
      better.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Will the idea of part b work with

      <p class="problem-part">Let x =.333... By multiplying both
      sides of this equation by 10, one

      <p class="problem-part">Now prove that .862862862... is a

      <p>If I have a larger number divisible by 3 and subtract a

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If I have a larger number and subtract a smaller number

    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>After having completed and digested the ideas of Problems
      44 and 45, we are now ready to understand why the
      divisibility test for 3 works. Remember that the divisibility
      test for 3 states that if the sum of the digits of a number
      is divisible by 3, then the number itself is as well. (You
      will prove below that it works for a three digit number, but
      your proof can be adapted easily to any number of
      digits.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">We can write 741 in the
      following
      way: $700 + 40 + 1$, and
      similarly we can write 6518 as $6000 + 500 + 10 + 8$. How
      could you write any number “ABC” in the same way, where A is
      the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and C is the units
      digit?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Consider 568, which is not
      divisible by 3. Notice that when you subtract the sum of its
      digits (5 + 6 + 8 =19) from itself, the answer you get, 549,
      is divisible by 3. Does this always work for any 3-digit
      number?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Use algebra to prove the result you
      found in part b. Your answer to part a. will be helpful
      here.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If $\left( {{\rm{A + B + C}}}
      \right)$ is also divisible by 3, by using what you learned in
      Problem 45 and parts b and c above, what can you now say
      about the number “ABC"? Explain!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If $\left( {{\rm{A + B + C}}}

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Pick a 3-digit number. If one subtracts the “reverse” of
      the number from the number itself, the answer is always a
      multiple of 9. For example $852 - 258 = 594$, which is a
      multiple of 9 (and negative numbers “work” as well — e.g. If
      we had picked 258, ). Explain why this is so. (Remember that
      any three digit number “ABC” can be written as $100{\rm{A}} +
      10{\rm{B}} + {\rm{C}}$ ; how do you think you could write
      its reverse, “CBA”?)
