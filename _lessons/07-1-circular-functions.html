    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>You’ve seen sine, cosine, and tangent before. In fact,
    you’ve even used them to find missing sides in triangles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you define the sine of $\theta $ ? Cosine of
      $\theta $ ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use careful construction of a triangle to find $\sin {37^
      \circ }$.
      Do not use the sine function on your calculator!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why can’t you use a construction to find $\sin {102^
      \circ }$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Even though we can’t construct a triangle to find the sine
    of ${102^ \circ }$, your
    calculator can tell you an approximate value! In this lesson,
    we will discover
    a new way to think about sine and cosine—a way that makes
    calculating the
    values of $\sin {102^ \circ }$, $\cos 1002^\circ$, and $\tan \left( { -
    {{10002}^ \circ }} \right)$ possible.</p>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development</h2>

    <p>Most of the problems in this section require carefully drawn
    diagrams.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A wheel of radius one foot is placed so that its center is
      at the origin, and a pin on the rim is at (1, 0). The diagram
      below shows the wheel after it has been spun an angle
      ${\theta ^{}}$ in a counterclockwise direction.









</p>
 
<p><figure class="fig-50">

  </figure></p>

<p>      Now consider the function $P(\theta )$, which outputs
      the
      coordinates of the pin after the wheel has been spun an angle
      ${\theta ^{}}$ in a counterclockwise direction. So, for
      example, $P({0^\circ})=(1,0)$ and $P({270^\circ})=(0, - 1)$.
      Find $P(\theta )$ when:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {90^ \circ }$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {45^ \circ }$. Give an
      exact answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {30^\circ}$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {57^\circ}$

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta $ is some measure between
      ${0^\circ}$ and ${90^\circ}$. (Your answer should be expressed in
      terms of $\theta $.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">For values of ${\theta ^{}}$ between ${0^\circ}$ and ${90^\circ}$, how are $\cos \theta $ and
      $P(\theta )$ related?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now, let’s consider angles greater than ${90^\circ}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Calculate $P(150^\circ)$, with P being the same
      position function as in question 4.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $P(253^\circ)$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Compare these values to the sine
      and cosine of $150^\circ$ and $253^\circ$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Using the diagram and your
      calculations, what do you think the tangent of $253^\circ$ is? The
      tangent of $150^\circ$? Check them on your calculator.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It is the convention for rotations that motion in a
    counterclockwise direction
      is considered <em class="vocab">positive</em>, while motion in a clockwise direction
    is considered
      <em class="vocab">negative</em>. So if our wheel is spun $57^\circ$ counterclockwise we would
    input $57^\circ$
    in our function $P(\theta )$, as we did in problem 1, but if
    our wheel is spun $57^\circ$ clockwise we would input $–57^\circ$ in our
    function $P(\theta )$. So the output for would be the
    coordinates of the pin after the wheel is spun $57^\circ$
    clockwise.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 240^\circ )$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 2640^\circ )$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 237^\circ )$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - \theta )$, where $0^\circ

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let $\cos \theta = - 0.4$.</p>

      true?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s revisit question 4, but with a wheel of radius 7
      feet
      instead of 1 foot. The wheel is still centered at $(0,0)$,
      and still with a pin at $(7,0)$. Let $Q(\theta )$ be the
      function which outputs the coordinates of the pin after this
      larger wheel has been spun an angle ${\theta ^{}}$ in a
      counterclockwise direction.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $Q(48^\circ )$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $Q(109^\circ )$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you define sine and

    <p>Surprise! There are actually three more trigonometric ratios

      <p>Paul rides a Ferris wheel for five minutes. The diameter
      of the wheel is 10 meters,
      and its center is 6 meters above the ground. Each revolution
      of the wheel takes 30 seconds. Paul's fear of heights kicks in when he is more than 9 meters above the ground. For

      <p>You have a circular dartboard. Its target area is defined
      in an unusual way. Take any point within the dartboard. Draw
      a straight line that goes through this point and the center
      of the board. Measure the angle this line makes with the line
      going from the center to the “easternmost” point on the dart
      board. If the tangent of this angle is between -0.2 and 0.6,
      then the point is shaded. Otherwise, it is not shaded. What
      are your chances of hitting this target area?</p>
