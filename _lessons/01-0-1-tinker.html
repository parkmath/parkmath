        <p>In a well-shuffled 52-card deck, half the cards are red
        and half are black. If the number of red cards in the top
        half of the deck is added to the number of black cards in the
        bottom half of the deck, the sum is 30. How many red cards
        are in the top half?

    <p>Many difficult problems that you come across can seem fairly
    straightforward, as frequently you have a good sense of where
    to start and what steps to take, even if each step is quite
    challenging. For some problems, though, the difficulty lies in
    not knowing at all what to do. In these cases it initially
    seems impossible to figure out how to get started.</p>

    <p>To <em class="vocab">Tinker</em> means to try possibilities and adjust your
    strategy based on what you’ve learned from your efforts.
    Tinkering is like trying to fit puzzle pieces together — you
    need to test out the pieces to see if they’ll fit, but even if
    it doesn’t work you now have a better sense of the shape of
    each piece.</p>

    <p>The important thing is to do something, even if you aren’t
    at all sure it will be helpful. Make a start. Don’t be
    paralyzed by the problem. When you work on a math problem, as
    you tinker, you are gathering information — information that
    might lead to a solution or that might lead to a more
    interesting question.</p>

    <p><em class="vocab">Trying a specific example</em>, even when the problem does not
    ask for one, is an example of <em class="vocab">tinkering</em>. In the above problem,
    for instance, try just guessing the number of red cards that
    are in the top half of the deck, and see what you can figure
    out from there. Even though your first guess is likely to be
    wrong, that’s perfectly OK. If you pay attention to the numbers
    you get for the amount of red and black cards in each half of
    the deck, you can adjust and make a much more educated guess
    the next time. That is, sometimes you will not notice a pattern
    until you generate some data for yourself.</p>

    <p><em class="vocab">Tinkering</em> is a way of making abstract ideas and hard to
    approach problems concrete, so that you can really see what is
    going on.</p>

    <p>The next few pages have a couple of problems for you to
    <em class="vocab">Tinker</em> with. After you have tried a few different approaches,
    you can turn over the page and see if the solution provided was
    similar to yours, or if perhaps you came up with a better
    way!</p>

    <p>Let’s start with a bit of a mystery:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>Each letter in the addition problem below represents a
          different number.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          $\begin{align}
          AB& \\
          \underline{+\quad BC}& \\
          ADD&
          \end{align}$
        </p>
        
        <p>What are the only
          possible values of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$?
          Try solving it before you turn over the page.</p>
            
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">After perhaps tinkering with a number of different random
    values for $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, just to see what seems to be working
    and what isn’t, you may have noticed that there is only one
    plausible value for $A$. What is it?</p>

    <p>So now our problem has turned into:</p>

    <p>
      $\begin{align}
      1B& \\
      \underline{+\quad BC}& \\
      1DD&
      \end{align}$
    </p>

    <p>Could $B$ be 7 or lower?</p>

    <p>If you conclude that $B$ is greater than 7, then it must be 8
    or 9. So tinker a bit here. Replace $B$
    by 9 and see what happens.</p>

    <p>The problem would then be:</p>

    <p>
      $\begin{align}
      19& \\
      \underline{+\quad 9C}& \\
      1DD&
      \end{align}$
    </p>

    <p>Now what could $D$ be? How about $C$?
    (Remember we were told all the letters
    represented <em>different</em> digits.)</p>

    <p>At this point you might have seen that $B$ must be 8. Now find
    $C$ and $D$, and be sure to check that your solution works.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>Here’s a logic puzzle that might drive you a bit crazy at
          first, but you’ll find the solution quite satisfying:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Al says: Bob is lying.</li>
          <li>Bob says: Carl is lying.</li>
          <li>Carl says: Al and Bob
            are both lying.</li>
          
        </ul>
        <p>Who is lying? Who is telling the truth?
          There is only one possible answer.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>If this seems impossible to solve, try just guessing
    right from the start who is telling the truth and
    who is lying, and see if your answer is consistent with what
    all three people are saying. If your initial
    answer doesn’t work, then adjust your guess and
    try again.</p>

    <p>The answer is on the back of this page.</p>

    <p class="new-page">There is no question that this problem can tie you up in
    logical knots! Let’s try to approach it by assuming Al is
    telling the truth, and we’ll see where that gets us. If this
    assumption works, great! And if it doesn’t, hopefully we will
    have learned some valuable information about the problem.</p>

    <p>If Al is telling the truth, that means that Bob is
    lying.</p>

    <p>If Bob is lying, that means that he is lying about Carl
    lying, which means that Carl is telling the truth.</p>

    <p>Now if Carl is telling the truth, that would mean that Al
    and Bob would both have to be lying. But we assumed at the
    start that Al was telling the truth! Al can’t both be telling
    the truth and lying. Our assumption that Al was telling the
    truth causes us to contradict ourselves, so it must be wrong.
    Therefore, since Al can’t be telling the truth, <em>Al must be
    lying.</em></p>

    <p>But does the problem really work out if Al is lying? Test it
    out and see.</p>

    <p>So, who is lying, and who is telling the truth?</p>

    <p>In case you were wondering if you could have started solving
    this problem by assuming, say, that Carl was telling the truth,
    and following the consequences from there, the answer is yes,
    absolutely. There are many ways to solve this problem, just as
    with many other math problems. The key is that all these
    different methods will eventually end up with the same
    answer.</p>

    <p>The next few pages have a variety of “Tinker” problems for
    you to enjoy. Have fun!
