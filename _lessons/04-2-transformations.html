    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In Lesson 1 of this chapter you saw several different
    quadratic models. Two of these models were $y = - {x^2} +
    400x$ and $y = - 20{x^2} + 360x$ . These models are
    different in the sense that the equations look different, but
    are their graphs different, too?</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>Set the window dimensions of your calculator to
      ${\rm{Xmin}} = - 50$, ${\rm{Xmax}} = 400$, ${\rm{Xscl}} =
      50$, ${\rm{Ymin}} = - 5000$,
      ${\rm{Ymax}} = 40000$, and ${\rm{Yscl}} = 5000$. Now, graph
      $y = - 20{x^2} + 360x$ and . What do you see? Are the
      graphs identical to each other?</p>
    </div>

    <p>While the graphs were not identical, they were both
    parabolas. When we studied transformations we learned that we
    can take a triangle, for example, and transform it into a
    triangle of the same shape but a different size and in a
    different place. We also learned that we can stretch a triangle
    in just one direction and change its shape while still
    preserving the fact that it’s a triangle. A natural
    question at this point might be the following: Can the graphs
    of the two
    parabolas seen in Problem 1 be transformed into each other? Put
    another way: Is it possible to take the graph of $y = - {x^2}
    + 400x$ and shift it, stretch it, or flip it over some line in
    order to get it to be identical to the graph of $y = - 20{x^2}
    + 360x$ ? Rather than tackle this actual question now, we
    will
    examine a similar problem by looking at simpler equations.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>Use the standard window to graph the quadratic
      function
      $y = {x^2}$ on your calculator. The standard window has
      ${\rm{Xmin}} = - 10$, ${\rm{Xmax}} = 10$, ${\rm{Xscl}} = 1$, ${\rm{Ymin}} = - 10$, ${\rm{Ymax}} = 10$, and
      ${\rm{Yscl}} = 1$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. For what values of $x$ does the
      graph, as you move from left to right, go down? go up?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Why does the graph not appear in
      the 3rd or 4th quadrants?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The previous questions were designed to help you get a feel
    for the shape of the graph of $y = {x^2}$. Often it helps to
    have this kind of feel before you start to
    investigate how you can transform this shape. So, now that you
    have a feel for this graph, let’s look at some transformations
    of it.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>In the same window you graphed $y = {x^2}$, graph $y =
      {x^2} + 3$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Do the graphs appear congruent —
      the exact same size and shape?</p>

    <p>The completed table in Problem 3 Part b should lead you to
    think that the graphs of $y = {x^2}$ and $y = {x^2} + 3$ really
    are congruent to each other,
    differing only in their location. It’s important to note that
    we haven’t proven
    this to be true; we’ve only gathered evidence that supports
    this notion.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>In what direction should you shift the graph of $y =
      {x^2}$ so that it would exactly coincide with the graph of $y
      = {x^2} + 3$?
      By how much should the graph be shifted? You should be able
      to give a precise answer to this.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One way of answering Problem 4 is by saying that the graph
    of $y = {x^2} + 3$ is a vertical translation up 3 units of the
    graph of $y = {x^2}$. There is synonymous language — vertical
    shift up 3 units, for example. Don’t worry about using the
    exact same terms that everyone else is using when trying to
    describe the transformation that has occurred, but do worry
    about whether your language is accurate.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>In the standard window graph $y = {x^2}$, $y = {x^2} + 6$, $y = {x^2} - 2$, and $y = {x^2} - 10$. Thinking about
      what you wrote in Problem 4, and what you read in the
      above
      paragraph, what conjecture can you make regarding the graphs
      of $y = {x^2}$ and $y = {x^2} + k$? Be specific.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>Graphical transformations allow us to produce new
      quadratic functions that as a consequence have transformed
      coordinate pairs.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. The point $\left( {5,25} \right)$ is on the graph of $y = {x^2}$. How could you shift the
      graph of $y = {x^2}$ to produce a new quadratic function
      where $\left( {5,32} \right)$ is on its graph? What would be
      the equation of this new graph?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. The point $\left( {4,16} \right)$ is on the graph of $y = {x^2}$. How could you shift the
      graph of $y = {x^2}$ to produce a new quadratic function
      where $\left( {4, - 77} \right)$ is on its graph? What would
      be the equation of this new graph?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="7">
      <p>Graph $y = {x^2}$, $y = 3{x^2}$, and in the standard
      window. Make sure you can see all of the important features
      of each of the graphs. Now, describe how you would
      transform the graph of $y = {x^2}$ into each of the other
      graphs. Be as precise as possible.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are many possible answers to Problem 7. A very common
    one is to say that you would horizontally compress (make
    narrower) toward the $y$-axis the graph of $y = {x^2}$ in order
    to get the graph of $y = 3{x^2}$ and horizontally stretch (make
    wider) away from the $y$-axis the graph of $y = {x^2}$ in order
    to get the graph of . Sometimes a person who describes the
    changes in this way will go on to write that the graph of $y =
    {x^2}$ would be compressed by a factor of 3 (made 1/3 as small)
    in the first case and stretched by a factor of 2 in the second
    case. It’s not easy checking the accuracy of these statements,
    but as it turns out, these statements about the factors are not
    quite right. Let’s look at another way of transforming the
    graph of $y = {x^2}$ into the graph of $y = 3{x^2}$ or the
    graph of .</p>

    <p>In Problems 3-6 we saw that if you add a quantity (positive
    or negative) to ${x^2}$ the graph of the new equation will
    shift vertically. Since 3 is multiplying ${x^2}$ in the
    equation $y = 3{x^2}$, let’s see whether the graph of $y =
    {x^2}$ changes vertically. In order to do this it’s best that
    we plug the same $x$-values into each equation and compare
    corresponding $y$-values.</p>

      $y = {x^2}$ at $x = - 2$— i.e., what is the vertical
      distance between the $x$-axis and the point on the graph
      where $x = - 2$? What is the height of $y = 3{x^2}$ at this
      same value of $x$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. How do the two answers you arrived
      at in Part a relate to each other? Would this be the same

      $x = - 1$? $x = 4$? If your answer is “no”, then come up

      each of these $x$-values.</p>

      of the transformations matter — in other words, if you

    <p>
    You may have noticed that it’s quite tedious to keep saying
    that the graph has been vertically stretched “away from the
    $x$-axis” or compressed “toward the $x$-axis”. In Chapter 1 you
    learned that there is a simple formula that describes dilations
    or compressions if their done around $\left( {0,0} \right)$.
    Throughout this lesson, we will be seeking simple, formulaic
    ways of describing vertical stretching or shrinking, so we will
    always take the $x$-axis as the line from which we stretch or
    toward which we compress. Hence, we will say, “the graph of $y
    = 3{x^2}$ is a vertical stretch by a factor of 3 of the graph
    of $y = {x^2}$”; there’s no need to mention the $x$-axis.</p>

    <p>
    You may have noticed in Problem 22 that the two graphs appear
    to be the same size and shape but are in different places along
    the $x$-axis. In this sense the graphs look like they’re
    horizontal translations of each other. One way of determining
    the precise magnitude and direction (left or right) of this
    translation is to focus on where the vertex is on each graph.
    Since these points correspond to each other — in the same way
    that the corner points of two triangles would correspond to
    each other — you can probably figure out what the horizontal
    translation is by looking at these points. The diagram below
    shows the two graphs, along with their indicated vertices.</p>

    <p>From this diagram we can see that the graph of appears to be
    4 units to the right of the graph of $y = {x^2}$. So, if we
    horizontally translate the graph of $y = {x^2}$ to the right 4
    units we can get the graph of $y = {\left( {x - 4} \right)^2}$. Notice that though the equation indicates that 4 is being
    subtracted from $x$, the graph moves right 4 units, not left 4
    units. Let’s look at a few more graphs before we investigate
    this apparently strange behavior.</p>

    <p>Problems 23 and 24 probably confirmed your sense of what was
    going on in Problem 22, not only in
    that the transformation is horizontal but also that it is
    “opposite” of what you might expect just from looking at the
    equation. One way of trying to understand what’s going on here
    is to isolate the variable that appears to be affected by the
    transformation — the “$x$” variable — by controlling the values
    of the other variable — the “$y$” variable. We can do this by
    creating a table in which the y-values are the same for each

      <p>When you learned transformations in the context of

      there aspects of the graph ($x$-intercepts, $y$-intercept,
      vertex, etc.) that don’t change? Are there aspects that do?
      Are these changes predictable? Are there aspects that change

      <p class="problem-part">. If you were going to graph $y =
      2{x^2} + 4$ by actually transforming the graph $y = {x^2}$

      stretch or should the transformations be done in the other
      order? Explain how you know that your answer is correct
      without referring to the graphing or table features of your
      calculator.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. There is an algebraically
      equivalent form of the equation $y = 2{x^2} + 4$ that will
      allow you to apply a vertical translation first and then a

      and/or the stretch will not necessarily be 4 and 2,
      respectively. Find this equivalent form.</p>
