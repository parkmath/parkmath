    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>You have already seen how coordinate geometry works, with
    the focus on slope and distance. Now you will be considering an
    earlier geometry, where there
    are no coordinates, so lines don’t have particular slopes, nor
    do we determine numerical distances between points. It’s just
    our reasoning and imagination that enable us to discover
    valuable relationships among the figures we draw.</p>

    <p>In this lesson, you will start to use this reasoning and
    imagination to help uncover
    the structure of geometry. Some things you know about geometry
    are simple and you may be happy to take them on faith. Others
    are less obvious, but can be explained by a careful argument.
    Still others may remain mysterious for now.</p>

    <p>To give you some tools, let’s start with the figure below,
    which you have probably seen in various contexts. The figure
    shows parallel lines a and b and line t crossing
    them. The line t is called a transversal, as it “moves” across
    the other pair
    of lines.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/parallel%20lines%20and%20transvers.svg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the figure above, label all the acute angles you
      believe to be equal in measure with the letter $x$. Then
      label all the obtuse angles you believe to be equal in
      measure with the letter $y$. Are there any angles that you
      haven’t labeled?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the relationship between the value of $x$ and the
      value of $y$? Make an argument that doesn’t depend on knowing
      the specific value of $x$ or of $y$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Some of these pairs of angles come up often enough so as to
    deserve special mention. In the diagram below angles
      1 and 3 are <strong>corresponding angles</strong>. Angles 3 and 7 are <strong>alternate
      interior angles</strong>. Angles 2 and 3 are
      <strong>same-side interior angles</strong>. Notice that lines $l$ and $m$ need
    not be parallel,
    yet the names still apply.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/non-parallel%20lines%20and%20trans.svg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Name another pair of angles in the above figure that
      are</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Corresponding.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Alternate interior.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Same-side interior.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the figure showing lines $l$ and $m$ not parallel, you’ll
      notice
      that there are no longer so many pairs of equal angles. But
      there is a fact that carries over from the previous figure.
      What is it, and how do you know for sure?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you have two parallel lines crossed by a transversal,
      do you think that the pairs of corresponding angles will
      always be equal? How about the pairs of alternate interior
      angles? Try to find an exception.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw another two parallel lines crossed by a transversal.
      The same-side interior angles probably don’t look equal. Is
      there anything else you can say about them? If you’re not
      sure, take some measurements.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development</h2>

    <p>The results you found/reviewed in the introduction are basic
    results in geometry. You may have learned them before, and you
    may consider them so obvious that you wonder why anyone would
    point them out. The reason is that we can use those simple
    facts to convince ourselves of some results that are not so
    simple!</p>

    <p>For instance, you have probably been raised to believe that
    there are 180 degrees in a triangle, even though that fact is
    not visually obvious. But the few results we’ve stated so far
    in this chapter can serve to convince us once and for all.</p>

    <p>Below is a triangle, meant to be general enough to stand for
    any triangle. It would be nice to use some of your findings so
    far to prove that the sum of its angles is 180 degrees.
    However, there are no parallel lines in this picture, so there
    doesn’t appear to be much we can do.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/Triangle%20ABC.svg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Add something to the diagram so that you do have some
      parallel lines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now that you have some parallel lines, label as many
      angles as you can that you know to be equal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now finish the proof that the angles of a triangle add up
      to 180 degrees.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You have probably known for a long time that the angles of a
    triangle add up to 180 degrees — in that sense, you did not
    learn any new facts by doing this proof. However, you may not
    have realized how strongly the result depends on alternate
    interior angles (or whichever angle pair you decided to use)
    being equal when lines are parallel. In fact, there are
    non-Euclidean geometries in which the alternate
    interior result is not true, where the alternate interior
    angles result is not true — and, sure enough, in those
    geometries, the angles of a triangle can actually add up to
    more or less than 180 degrees!</p>

    <p class="new-page">The ancient Greeks appreciated how important it was to
    uncover the structure of geometry, and very often looked for
    proofs of statements they were pretty sure were true using
    statements they already knew to be true. They tried to reduce
    the number of statements they accepted without proof to the
    smallest number possible. The most famous Greek geometer,
    Euclid, was able to reduce his number of assumptions to five
    mathematical statements and five “common notions” — like “two
    things equal to the same thing are equal to each other.” He was
    able to prove a huge amount of geometry from these simple
    assumptions.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the spirit of Euclid, try to prove that angles 1 and
      3
      below are equal. What facts are you relying on?</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/Vertical%20angles.svg" >
    </figure>
    </div>
    
    <p>The rest of this Development consists of examples of some
    other argument styles that do not involve coordinates.</p>

    <p class="new-page">Another fact you have known for a long time is that the area
    of a triangle can
    be found by the formula $\text{Area } = \frac12 \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}$.
    You might also have seen the following picture, designed to
    show why the formula is true for right triangles.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/Right%20triangle%20in%20rectangle.svg" >
    </figure>

    <p>But alas, not all triangles are right, and we’d still like
    to be able to use this familiar formula with any triangle. So
    below is triangle $ANY$.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/Triangle%20ANY.svg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Add something to the diagram so that you can use what
      you know about the area of rectangles and right triangles
      to find its area. Is your formula equivalent to $\text{Area } = \frac12 \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>And last, but not least, a Physical Challenge:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Using only a compass and a tool for
      drawing straight lines, construct an equilateral triangle.
      Your tool for drawing straight lines may not be a ruler, or
      anything else that can take measurements.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Come up with an argument that would
      convince a friend that the triangle you constructed really
      has to be equilateral and, if they did the same thing, their
      triangle would be
      equilateral, too.</p>

    There are a number of other two-dimensional forms that we can
    find the areas of now that we know the area formulas for
    rectangles and triangles. Here are some.</p>

    <p>Draw a triangle $ANY$ and a line parallel to $\overline
    {AY} $ so that it cuts through the sides $\overline {AN} $ and
    $\overline {NY} $.
    Let $\overline {BC} $ represent the parallel line
    intersecting
    the triangle. Now erase what’s above $\overline {BC} $.
    You’re
    looking at what is called a trapezoid — a four-sided figure
    with one pair of parallel sides.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Knowing what you do about the areas of triangles and
      rectangles, come up with a formula for the area of a

    <p>The ancients who studied form naturally included others
    besides the Greeks. There were the Egyptians who designed and
    built pyramids and came up with a very interesting formula for
    the area of a circle (see if you can find it on Google and see
    what an impressive fit it provides). The Babylonians also
    studied form, and they came up with a formula for the area of a
    quadrilateral.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The Babylonians’ formula for the area of a quadrilateral
      is ${\rm{Area = }}\frac{{(a + b)(c + d)}}{4}$, where $a$ and $c$

      quadrilateral, and $b$ and $d$ are the other. Does their formula

      <p>Earlier in this lesson, you probably decided
      that, if you have lines crossed by a

      a suggestion for arguing that your conjecture must be the

      <p>The polygons you have studied in this
      unit have mostly been convex. When
      you pick any two points inside a convex polygon and connect
      them with a straight line segment, the line segment always
      stays within the polygon. If there are two points where the
      line connecting them must go outside the polygon, then the
      polygon is called nonconvex.</p>

      <p>First remind yourself of the result in problem #31. Then
      consider the following image. As you have seen in Euclidean
      geometry parallel lines are infinite lines in the same plane
      that don’t intersect. Given the circle as the entire
      universe, lines $AB$ and $DE$ are said to be parallel, as are lines $AC$ and $DE$, as neither pair
      has any intersection points within the circle. However, lines $AB$ and $AC$ are
      not parallel. How does this finding fit with your finding in
      problem 31?</p>

      <p>Draw a good-sized equilateral triangle and pick any point
      inside the triangle. From that point draw the three
      perpendiculars to the three sides of the triangle. Let the
      lengths of the three perpendiculars be $a$, $b$, and $c$. If $d =$ height or altitude of the triangle, show that $a + b + c =

      <p>Draw a right triangle. On each of the three sides of the
      triangle draw equilateral triangles where the side of the
      original triangle is also a side of the new triangle. Each of
      those equilateral triangles has an area. Does it seem that
      the sum of the areas of the equilateral triangles on the legs
      of the right triangle is equal to the area of the equilateral
      triangle on the hypotenuse? Can you prove this? (Hint: what
      do you know about 30°-60°-90° triangles?)</p>
