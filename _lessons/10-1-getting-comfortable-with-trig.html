<h1>Lesson 1: Getting Comfortable with Trig</h1>
  <section class="development">




    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In an earlier lesson, you learned how the trigonometric
    functions sine, cosine, and tangent were defined for angles
    other than those between 0 and 90 degrees. Here is a quick
    refresher.</p>

    <p>Imagine sitting at the edge of a merry-go-round with radius
    1 meter. You’ve set up a coordinate system with (0,0) at the
    center of the merry-go-round, and the point (1,0) is due east
    from (0,0). When the wheel starts to turn counterclockwise,
    your position is (1,0).</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the merry-go-round has rotated $42^\circ$ from its
      starting
      position, find the coordinates of your position.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the merry-go-round has rotated $200^\circ$ from its
      starting
      position, find the coordinates of your position.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This may be enough to remind you of the generalized
    definitions of sine and cosine. In the figure below, a “spoke”
    of a circle of radius 1 is drawn so that it makes a central
    angle of $\theta $ with the positive $x$-axis. The spoke
      intercepts the circle at the point $(x,y)$. The <em class="vocab"></em>sine of an
      angle $\theta $ is the $y$-coordinate of this point. The <em class="vocab">cosine</em>
    of $\theta $ is the $x$-coordinate of this point.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/Lesson%201%20-%20graph%202.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the figure above, how would you define the tangent
      of $\theta $?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In middle school, you learned that $\sin \theta $ is
      defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite $\theta$ in a right triangle to the length of the hypotenuse. Where is the right triangle in the figure above,
      and what are the opposite and hypotenuse?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you determine the sine, cosine, and tangent of
      an angle using a circle with a different radius than 1?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The circle with radius one is better known in mathematical
    circles as the “unit circle.” You’ll want to draw it — or a
    circle with a well-chosen radius — almost every time you solve
    a trig problem.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Cecilia is on a Ferris wheel and notices that, when she
      has rotated about 143 degrees from due east, she is 24 meters
      west and 18
      meters above the center of the wheel. Use this information
      to
      approximate the sine, cosine, and tangent of 143 degrees.
      Then
      see how you did by asking your calculator for these
      values.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For each diagram, find the sine and cosine of the angle
      $\theta $.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Copy the following 30-60-90 triangle and 45-45-90 triangle
      into your notebook. Then write in the remaining angles and
      find the remaining sides in terms of $x$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Problem 2 may have reminded you that whether the sine or
    cosine of an angle is positive or negative depends on which
      <em class="vocab">quadrant</em> the angle is in. This allows you to answer questions
    like the following.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Go back to your 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles and think
      about positioning them on the unit circle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Name all angles between 0 and 360
      degrees that have a
      sine of $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Name all angles between 0 and 360
      degrees that have a
      cosine of $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Name all angles between 0 and 360
      degrees that have a
      tangent of 1.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Now explain how to find <em>all</em> the
      angles that have a sine
      of $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve the equation $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$. How many
      solutions are there? How many solutions are interestingly
      different from one another?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Of course, you might also have to solve equations that don’t
    involve sines
    or cosines of angles in special triangles. For instance, if you
    had to solve $\sin \theta = .2531$, you would be forced to
    resort to the inverse sine function on
    your calculator.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make sure your calculator is in degree mode, then take the
      inverse sine of .2531 to solve this equation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw the “wheel” again, and draw a spoke at the angle that
      has sine .2531. Remembering that the sine of an angle is the
      height of a point above the $x$-axis, indicate the other point
      on the wheel that would have the same sine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you calculate the size of this second angle with
      sine .2531? Do so.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Give <em>all</em> the solutions to the equation $\sin \theta =
      .2531$.</p>

    <h2>Further
    Development</h2>

    <p>You’re used to measuring temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
    but you also know that much of the world measures temperature
    using degrees Celsius. Similarly, the world uses miles and
    kilometers, ounces and grams, gallons and liters.</p>

    <p>When the Babylonians invented degree measure, they chose a
    360-degree circle for two reasons. One was that, since there
    are 365 days in a year, a degree would be very close to one
    day’s progress around the circular path they believed the sun
    made every year. Another reason is that 360 is divisible by
    lots of numbers, so
    we can describe a fourth, a sixth, an eighth, and a tenth of a
    circle as an integer number of degrees. (Try this with a 100
    degree circle and you’ll see it doesn’t work as well.)</p>

    <p>As time went on, though, mathematicians realized that the
    number 360 didn’t
    really have anything to do with circles, and in fact some of
    their calculations would be easier if they used a different
    system. This system was inspired by the close relationship
    between a central angle of a circle and the arc it intercepts.
    It was also inspired by the importance of the unit circle.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/Lesson%201%20-%20graph%2023.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Specifically, we’d like the measure of a central angle in
    the unit circle to be literally the same as the length of the
    arc it intercepts.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the circumference of the unit circle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since a 360 degree “central angle” intercepts the entire
    circle your answer to Problem 24 will be the equivalent of 360
    degrees in our new system.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How much of a circle does a 180 degree central angle
      intercept? So, in this new system, how should we represent a
      180 degree angle?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Under this new system, what should we call the measure of
      an angle that intercepts a quarter-circle?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What should we call the measure of an angle that
      intercepts
      a sixth of a circle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>When you measure angles this way, you are measuring in
      <em class="vocab">radians</em>. (Try pressing the MODE button on your calculator and
    notice that there is a radian vs. degree option.) The next
    problems suggest a reason for the name.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many times does the radius of a circle “fit” around
      the circumference? (Hint: remember that the circumference of
      a circle is $C = 2\pi r$.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Say you have an angle that intercepts an arc on the unit
      circle equal to two of its radii. How many radians is that
      angle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you are about to solve an equation like $\sin \theta = \dfrac {\sqrt {3}} {2}$, you might not
    know whether to give your answer in degrees or radians. Your
    class should agree on which system to use.</p>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If 60 degrees is equivalent to $\dfrac{\pi }{3}$ radians,
      how many radians are in</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. 240 degrees?</p>

      <p>Another way of thinking of radian measure

      works when the central angle is measured in radians instead
      of degrees.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In 10th grade, you also found a formula for the area of
