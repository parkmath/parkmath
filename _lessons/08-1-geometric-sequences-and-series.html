    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Designers, poets, mathematicians, and most everyone
    appreciates patterns.
    Our bodies and minds like patterns, such as sequences of
    behaviors and mental practices that are organized and
    efficient, like the pattern of actions you follow
    in coming to school every morning and the procedure you know to
    solve a
    particular class of problems.</p>

    <p>You saw patterns of numbers that formed sequences when you
    worked with arithmetic sequences, such as: 3, 8, 13, 18, ….
    Below are three sequences. Which two of the three share a
    common characteristic? What is that special effect?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Putting a picture on a copier and hitting the 100% enlarge
      button five times; and then creating a sequence of numbers
      representing the widths of each of the five different
      images.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Taking a cherry from a bowl, then taking 3 more than the
      first pick, then taking 6 more than the second pick, then
      taking 12 more; and then writing down the number of
      cherries that you have taken one time after the other.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Starting with a cookie, take away half a cookie, then take
      away a half of the remaining portion, then another half
      of what remains, and another half; and then creating a
      sequence of how much of the original cookie remained after
      each removal.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development:
    Geometric Sequences</h2>

    <p>Earlier you considered arithmetic sequences, which are
    sequences having a
    common difference, $d$, between terms. So we would be inclined
    to describe the sequence 6, 10, 14 as an arithmetic sequence,
    for we could see the sequence
    having a first term ${T_1} = 6$ with $d=4$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The two sequences in problems 1-3 above that were similar
        are referred to as <em class="vocab">geometric sequences</em>. How would you
      describe them in English?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The next term of the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54 could be 162, as
    the sequence begins with 2 and each succeeding term can be
    created by multiplying the prior term by 3. So we could say it
    was a geometric sequence where each term after the first is
    created by multiplying by 3, so $54 \cdot 3 = 162$. We will
      call 3 the <em class="vocab">multiplier</em>, or <em class="vocab">common ratio</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, …, we can represent the
      first term, 2, as ${T_1}$, the second term, 6, as ${T_2}$,
      etc.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you represent the third
      term, ${T_3}$, in terms of ${T_1}$ and the
      multiplier?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you represent the fourth
      term, in terms of ${T_1}$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about the $n$th term, ${T_n}$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If we had the geometric sequence 5, 10, 20, what would
      ${T_5}$ and ${T_7}$ be?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the last problem if you weren’t told that the sequence
    was geometric, you could think that the sequence 5, 10, 20, …
    wasn’t geometric. You might well
    have noticed that the successive differences between terms form
    a pattern: first 5, then 10; so this could lead you to think
    that the next term of the sequence would be 15 more than the
    prior term of 20; namely, 35. In general any
    sequence, no matter how many terms are given, is open to the
    next term being of infinite possibility — if one is clever
    enough to choose it so that it fits the form of the sequence
    terms.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the sequence had 35 after 20, how could you argue that
      the sequence wasn’t geometric?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Considering the geometric sequence: 4, 6, 9, …,</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What would you say would be the
      next two terms?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you write the general
      term, ${T_n}$, of the sequence?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can you describe another pattern
      beginning with the terms 4, 6, and 9 that would not be
      geometric? What would be the 6th term?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Create values for $a$ and $b$ that establish patterns for
      each
      of the following sequences. See if you can generalize by
      expressing mathematically the general term, ${T_n}$.
      [Note: these need not be geometric sequences.]</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What about in the sequence 15, $x$,
      375?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about
      $\frac{5}{2},x,\frac{{125}}{2}$? And
      $\frac{2}{5},x,\frac{2}{{125}}$?
      What is $r$, the multiplier?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can you create a proportion for
      each of these three-term sequences so that the common ratio,
      $r$, can be easily
      observed?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What would you think the graph of a geometric sequence
      would look like? Choose some geometric sequence and draw the
      graph with the number of the term, $n$, on the
      $x$-axis and the value of the term, ${T_n}$, on the
      $y$-axis. How would you compare this image to the one
      obtained by drawing an arithmetic sequence?</p>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

      2$ and

      the 4th and
      14th terms if you halved $r$? Check your guess.</p>

          of another square board that would have half the area of
          the prior one? And half again? Bowser said, “I don’t
          know. But to keep things in proportion, we should halve
          the area of our pizza with the 8” radius every time we
          halve the area of the board.” As Bowser and Lulu are
          dogs, what would you determine the four consecutive
          halvings of the board and the pizza to be?</p>
        </div>

    <h2>Going Further: Geometric Series</h2>
    
        <p>
        As you saw with arithmetic sequences, we create an
        arithmetic series by summing the consecutive terms of such
        a sequence.</p>

        <div class="problem">
          <p>Do you recall for any arithmetic series how to express
          the sum of the first $n$ terms? If not, make up an
          arithmetic sequence and see if that triggers any
          memories.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Because we clearly didn’t want to spend time
        adding all the terms for an arithmetic series when the
        number of terms is beyond a few, we made a commitment to
        find a formula. And to do that we had to look at the series
        in an imaginative way. Well, that holds also for coming up
        with a formula for a geometric series.</p>

        <p>The clever technique that allows us to generate
        the formula for the sum of a geometric series is called
        “telescoping”. Let’s try the technique with a concrete
        instance. Suppose we are asked to find the sum of the
          geometric series: <nobr>$1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \ldots 512$.</nobr> Let’s
        call the sum $S$ and write:</p>

    <p>$S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \ldots 512$.</p>

        <div class="problem">
          <p>Now multiply both sides by 2 (since
            <nobr>$r = 2$),</nobr> and write a new equation. Try to combine the
          two equations (by addition or subtraction) into one
          equation that gives you an “easy” way to calculate $S$.
          Can you make sense of why the method is called
          “telescoping”?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem">
          <p>Use your understanding of what you did in Problem 30
          to calculate the sum of the following geometric
          series:
          
          
          $S = \frac{3}{1} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{{16}} +

          your month’s work or getting the amount determined by
          summing the amount of money you
          would receive for 30 days, starting with one penny on the
          first day, and doubling the amount for each succeeding

          arrange to get a pair of decent sneakers because his feet
          were killing him after running on the ground barefoot all
          these years. To show off a bit, get the sneakers, and
          save wear and tear on his feet, Tarzan told Jane that he
          would swing from vine to vine without coming down for an
          hour. She agreed to give him money for each vine switch,
          starting with \$1, and then doubling the amount for each
          subsequent switch (since the same activity gets harder as
          even Tarzan gets tired over time).</p>

          <p>Here’s a very special sequence from
          history. It’s called the Fibonacci sequence named after
          Leonardo of Pisa, whose
          surname was Fibonacci. He put together the following
          sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, Perhaps you’ve seen it

          <p>Creating sequences can be great fun and sometimes the
          outcomes can be quite outstanding.</p>

          <p class="problem-part">Consider the sequence 1/1, 3/2,
          7/5, … where each succeeding term is created by adding
          the top and
          bottom of the fraction to create the new denominator, and
          adding the top and twice the bottom to get the numerator.
          Try this for a number of terms. And if you can write or
          find someone who can write a calculator program, see if
          you can guess where this sequence is going.</p>

          <p class="problem-part">Here is another special
          sequence: 4/1, 8/3, 32/9, … where to get the nth term
          first determine if $n$, the number of the term, is even
          or odd. If it’s even, multiply the previous term by
          $\frac{n}{{n + 1}}$; if it’s odd multiply
          by $\frac{{n + 1}}{n}$. See if you get an idea where
          this sequence is going toward. (From Prime Obsession, by
