    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In this chapter, you have proven many properties of
    triangles and quadrilaterals. You’ve known about some of these
    properties for a long time; others may have been new to you.
    You have also set about creating a structure for the
    geometry
    you know, choosing certain facts to consider as basic and
    showing how other facts depend on those. At this point, you are
    well beyond the basics, and you have probably already begun to
    make conjectures about ideas you haven’t thought about
    before.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In your notebook, use a compass to draw a circle. Then
      draw two chords of two different lengths that cross somewhere
      inside the circle. Label the endpoints of one chord $A$ and $B$,
      and the endpoints of another chord $C$ and $D$. The chords cross
      at point $E$. Now measure $\overline {AE} $, $\overline
      {EB} $, $\overline {CE} $, and $\overline {ED} $. Try
      calculating $AE \cdot EB$
       and $CE \cdot ED$.
       What do you find?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In this section, most ideas that come up will probably be
    new, and many, like the result above, will be unexpected. You
    will be in a good position to make some conjectures and to
    prove many of the conjectures you make.</p>

    <p>After looking at parallel lines, triangles, and
    quadrilaterals, we’ll now turn our attention to circles. Many
    of the theorems you’ve already established will prove useful in
    investigating circles. Circles themselves often prove useful in
    analyzing other shapes, as you’ve probably realized when doing
    compass-and-straightedge constructions. In the development,
    most of your time will be spent learning the substantial
    vocabulary that has to do with circles. Then you’ll learn and
    prove
    a few basic properties of circles. In the problems section, you
    will have freer
    rein to conjecture and prove more things about circles, and
    about geometry in general.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Your submarine has a rotating radar beam that is used to get
    a picture of the
    surrounding area. Your radar screen looks like this,</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-5-building-theorems/Radar%20beam.svg" >
    </figure>

    <p>with the bold line segment showing the motion of the radar
    beam. As the beam rotates, the screen updates based on what the
    beam finds.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why do you think the radar screen is in the shape of a
      circle, rather than, say, a rectangle?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Say that you know that the circle the screen makes has a
      circumference of 360 millimeters. What’s the length of the
      edge of the screen that has been updated since the beam was
      pointing due east? Answer this question for each
      picture below.</p>
    </div>

    <figure>
      <img src="
      ../images/06-5-building-theorems/three radar beams replacement.png
    " >
    </figure>

    <p>Recall that the ${150^ \circ }$ angle in the rightmost
      picture above is called a <em class="vocab">central angle</em>. As you can see,
    there’s a direct relationship between a central angle and the
      arc it <em class="vocab">intercepts</em>, even if the circumference of the circle is
    not 360 millimeters.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="
      ../images/06-5-building-theorems/three central angles replacement.png
    " >
    </figure>

    <p>Because of this relationship, people also talk about the
      angular <em class="vocab">measure of an arc</em>. The measures of the arcs above are
    ${90^ \circ }$, $135^\circ$, and ${270^ \circ }$ . So both of the
    arcs below have measure ${90^ \circ }$, even though their
    lengths are very different.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="
      ../images/06-5-building-theorems/arcs replacement.png
    " >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the measure of the arc that borders the portion of
      the radar screen between east and northwest?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the measure of the arc that borders the portion of
      the radar screen between north and south-southeast?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If an arc of a circle has measure ${47^ \circ }$,
      what’s the measure of the arc you’d need to form the rest of
      the circle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>To refer to an arc, you use the two points where the arc
    begins and ends. Here’s arc AB, or, better yet, $\newcommand{arc}[1]{\stackrel{\Large\frown}{#1}}\arc{AB}$.</p>

    <figure class="fig-25">
      <img src="../images/06-5-building-theorems/Arc%20AB.svg" >
    </figure>

    <p>Of course, when we’re talking about arcs that are parts of
    circles, naming arcs this way has a little problem…</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/06-5-building-theorems/Major%20vs%20minor%20arc.svg" >
    </figure>

    <p>…because how would we know whether we meant the arc that
    looks like it’s about ${90^ \circ }$, or the one that looks
    like it’s about ${270^ \circ }$? When you don’t specify,
      it’s assumed that you mean the smaller, or <em class="vocab">minor arc</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw a circle in your notebook. Pick points $Q$ and $Z$
      anywhere on the circle. Use measuring tools (and perhaps a
      bit of ingenuity) to find the measure of arc QZ. Then
      describe a general strategy for finding arc measure.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Another type of angle in a circle is called an <em class="vocab">inscribed</em>
      angle. An inscribed angle has its vertex <em>on</em> the circle, not at the center. Inscribed angles can intercept
    arcs, too.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="
      ../images/06-5-building-theorems/inscribed angle replacement.png
    " >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here’s a ${45^ \circ }$ inscribed angle. Does it look
      like it also
      intercepts a ${45^ \circ }$ arc?</p>
    </div>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-5-building-theorems/45%20degree%20inscribed%20angle.svg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>There is a conjecture to be found here. Draw some more
      circles with inscribed angles, and find it.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Now that you have a conjecture, it’s time to look for a
    proof. The following problems will help you.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Below is a picture of an inscribed angle $BAC$, which
      intercepts the same arc as central angle $BOC$.</p>


    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="
      ../images/06-5-building-theorems/inscribed angle problem 10.png
    " >
    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">Using geometric tinkering, find the
    measure of $\angle BOC$ in terms of $x$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">The proof that you’ve done does not
    work for the diagram in problem 8. What goes wrong?</p>
      
    </div>
    
    <p>Here is another diagram, one that looks more like the
    situation in problem 8.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="
      ../images/06-5-building-theorems/inscribed angle after prob 10 1.png
    " >
    </figure>

    <p>Since we already know something about when one of the sides
    of an angle is a diameter, let’s draw in the diameter and label
    the angles this way:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="
      parkmath/images/06-5-building-theorems/inscribed angle after prob 10 2.png
    " >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using this diagram, prove that the central angle is still
      twice the inscribed angle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Between problems 10 and 11, will your proofs work for all
      inscribed angles? If so, great. If not, draw a picture of an
      inscribed angle, along with its associated central angle, for
      which the proofs will not work.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For this problem, think of an analog clock (a clock with
      hands).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find the angle determined by the
      hands of a clock when it is 4 o’clock. What’s the measure of
      the arc formed by the edge of the clock between the 12 and
      the 4?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now imagine that you draw a line
      from the 12 to the 8 and then from the 8 to the 4. What’s the
      angle formed at the 8?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What’s the measure of the arc
      formed by the edge of a clock between the 7 and the 11?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Create an inscribed angle by
      starting at the 7, going to any time on the clock not between
      7 and 11 o’clock, and then going to the 11. How will this
      compare with your angle in part c?</p>

      you can. A dot indicates the center of the circle.</p>
