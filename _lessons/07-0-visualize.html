          <p>In the following picture, rectangle ABCD is inscribed in
          a
          quarter-circle. $DC = 5$, and $CE = 4$. Can you figure
          out the
          length of diagonal AC?</p>

      <p>Often a problem that can seem particularly
      perplexing can be solved by looking at it in a
      different way. Sometimes the best way to keep
      track of the different information and variables
      in a problem is to draw a picture of some sort,
      to visualize the information so that it is in a form that is
      easier to understand. You saw this last year as you solved a
      variety of problems, at times by constructing models, and at
      times by finding clever ways to visually represent things
      that at first seemed quite nonvisual.</p>

        <p>Four trees are planted at each corner of a square park.
        The city wants to expand the park to twice its current
        area, but in such a way that the park is still a square,
        and none of the four trees is in the interior of the park.
        (The trees cannot be transplanted.) Draw a plan for a new
        park that meets these criteria.

        <p>Craziola, the wacky pizza guy, has decided he wants to
        cut a pizza into as many
        pieces as possible, with as few straight cuts as possible.
        He doesn’t care at all if the pieces are of equal size, he
        just wants to make the most number of distinct pieces.
        With 1 cut, he produces 2 pieces. With 2 cuts, he creates a
        maximum of 4 pieces, no matter how crazy the 2 cuts he
        makes are. How many pieces can he possibly make with 3
        cuts? 4 cuts? What about n cuts? Can you find the
