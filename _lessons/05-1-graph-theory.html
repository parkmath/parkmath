    <h2>Introduction: Three Challenges</h2>

    <p>Felix will fly into Birmingham tomorrow to visit some family
    members. Today, he has his Alabama map spread out over a table
    in the local coffee shop to determine the route he will drive with his
    pay-per-mile rental car. He has a cousin in Birmingham, grandparents in
    Huntsville, an aunt in Cottondale, and a brother in Tuscaloosa. When Felix
    realized that he’ll soon be served some of his grandma’s chicken
    liver-sardine-cranberry casserole, he gagged on his cappuccino and
    accidentally spilled the whole cup on his map. The only usable part of the
    map remaining is the mileage chart between cities. Here is the mileage
    between the relevant cities:</p>

    countries are touching, then you should make them different

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>To determine Felix’s driving route, you probably recognized
    a way to represent the situation visually — whether you
    sketched out a map or drew a diagram.</p>

    <p>The second and third problems, however, didn’t have an
    obvious new representation
    to apply. Some people probably applied labels; others may have
    made lists. It turns out, though, if we use the method of the
    first problem with the second and third, we can learn much more
    from the data!</p>

    <p>Most likely, the diagram you used in the first problem was
    actually a graph. A graph, in its most general sense, is a
    collection of dots (called “nodes”) and lines connecting them
    (called “edges”). In your graph of Felix’s problem, the nodes
    represented cities, and the edges related the nodes by showing
    the distances between.</p>

    <p>We can represent the second situation with a graph, too, if
    we let each country be represented by a node. We can draw an
    edge between nodes when those countries border each other. Our
    graph comes out to look like this:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/mid%20east%20graph.png"
      alt="mid%20east%20graph.png">
    </figure>

    <p>The problem now becomes to color each dot in such a way that
    any two dots connected by lines are always different
    colors.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the minimum number of colors you need now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Did you think this version of the “coloring” problem was
      easier than in the introduction? Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Similarly, we can represent the scheduling problem as a
    graph. The nodes can represent classes, and an edge can connect
    the nodes in the cases where some student wants to take both
    classes, as in the figure below.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/schedule%20planar.png"
      alt="schedule%20planar.png">
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve the scheduling problem using this representation.
      What minimum number of blocks can you identify now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Was this version of the schedule problem easier than in
      the introduction? Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The tools you have been using so far in this lesson are the
    tools of graph theory.
    Already, graph theory has been über-useful in helping us
    represent relationships in a very streamlined way. What’s more,
    we can now see that the map-coloring problem and the scheduling
    problem — initially very different — are actually remarkably
    similar.</p>

    <p>In fact, the identically structured graphs of the
    map-coloring problem and the scheduling problem are isomorphic.
    Two graphs are isomorphic when each node in one graph has a
    “partner” node in the other — a “partner” with the same
    connections. For example, Georgia in the first graph and
    Astronomy in the second correspond to one another. So do
    Lebanon and Advanced Calc. This correspondence comes from their
    identically structured connections, not their actual position
    on the page.</p>

    <p>The following two graphs are not isomorphic.<br></p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/Not isomporphic.png">
    </figure>

    <p>An easy way to see that the graphs are not isomorphic is to
    see that node B has no “partner.” In the left hand graph, B has
    three edges coming out of it. On the right, no node has three
    edges coming out of it, so B has no possible “partner.” The
    number of edges connected to a node is a very important
    characteristic. The degree of a node (abbreviated deg(n)) is
    the number of edges coming out of it. So in the left-hand graph
    deg(A) = 1 and deg(B) = 3. What is deg(C)?</p>

    <p class="new-page">Isomorphisms can be trickier to spot than we’ve seen so far.
    For example, someone else with the task of drawing the
    scheduling graph might have come up with the following:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src=
      "../images/05-1-graph-theory/nonplanar schedule.jpg" alt=
      "nonplanar schedule.jpg">
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Check to see if this graph is still an accurate
      representation of the scheduling problem. Explain, in
      language a sixth-grader could understand, what you need to do
      to check if two graphs are isomorphic.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One final important concept that we will use is planarity.
    In the second
    version of the schedule graph, some edges crossed at places
    other than nodes. (For example, the edge connecting Animal
    Behavior to Shakespeare crosses the edge connecting Astro to
    Discrete.) In these cases, you can think of the edges passing
    under or over each other.</p>

    <p>Graphs where you don’t have to do this — where there is a
    way you can draw them without crossing the edges — are called
    planar.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why do you think the word “planar” might be used?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Note that a graph might be drawn with the edges crossing,
    and yet be isomorphic to a graph that is clearly planar, as in the following
    two graphs (with pairing 1-d, 2-a, 3-b, 4-c):</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/planar.png" alt=
      "planar.png">
    </figure>

    <p>In this case, we still say the first graph is planar because
    it can be drawn with no edges crossing and still represent the
    same information. Imagine picking up nodes 1 and 2, with their
    edges still attached, and “uncrossing” them to get something
    with the same shape as the second graph.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw a nonplanar graph.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find some degrees of nodes in the Middle East graph.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is deg(Saudi Arabia)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is deg(Syria)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What country’s node has the

      <p>A shelter needs to find homes for nine cats. The table
      below indicates with an “x” which pairs of cats do not get
      along. Assuming that cats who do not get along cannot go with
      the same family, what is the minimum number of families
      needed to adopt all of these cats?</p>

      <p>The Game of Sprouts: Mark a few dots on a piece of paper.
      A move consists of two actions: connect two different dots
      with a single edge then place a dot at around the middle of
      this edge. You can only connect two dots if each has a degree
      of less than 3, and you may not repeat an edge or cross
      edges. The person who has no move is the loser.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If you start with only two dots,
      then how many moves can the game last?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">At the end of the two-dot sprouts
      game, what will be the total degree of the diagram?</p>
