    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Fill in the blanks to continue the pattern you see in this
      list:
      $2,\;7,\;6,\;11,\;10,\;15,\;\_\_\,,\;\_\_\,,\,\_\_\,,\;\_\_\,,
      \ldots $</p>
    </div>

    <p>In mathematics, a <em class="vocab">sequence</em> is a list of 
      numbers, usually
    with an identifiable
    pattern or a connection to real data — for example, the list of
    expected
    temperatures for the next ten days, or a sequence listing the
    profits that a
    business earned year by year.</p>

    <p>The numbers in the sequence are called $terms$— for
    example, in the sequence above, 2 is the first term. Sometimes
    this pattern is very simple: $2,4,6,8…$. Other times it might be
    harder to spot, like the problem above. Or, it might be an
    unusual type of pattern — $0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1…$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with the next two numbers in the sequence
      $1,3,6,10, \ldots $, and a reason for why they should be the
      two numbers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How about the next two numbers in the sequence
      $2,5,10,13,26,29, \ldots $?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make up a sequence that you think will challenge your
      neighbor — then see if they can find the pattern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A sequence starts with the numbers 5, 15, 35.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="a">. Describe a pattern that this
      sequence might be following, and give the next three terms
      according to the pattern.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="b">. Now describe a different pattern
      that the sequence might be following, and give the next three
      terms according to the new pattern.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The patterns you’ve seen so far have often been related to
    the differences
    between terms, such as the patterns in problems 1 and 2. When
    the pattern in a sequence is simply that the difference is
    always the same, the sequence is called an <em class="vocab">
    arithmetic
    sequence</em>. For example, $7,9,11,13…$ is one of these.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Some of the sequences below are arithmetic, and some are
      not. For each sequence, only a few terms are given.
      Identify
      whether or not the sequence appears to be arithmetic. Also
      for each sequence find a pattern and fill in the missing
      terms.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="a">. 3, 6, 12, 24, ___, ___, …</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="b">. 4, 11, 18, ___, ___, ….</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="c">. 9, ___, 17, ___, 25, ….</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="d">. 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, ___, ___,….</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="e">. 47, 43, 39, ___, 31, ___, ___,
      ….</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="f">. 13, 16, 22, 24, 28, 36, ___, ___,
      ___....</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>In a sequence, it’s not only the numbers that matter—the
    order of the numbers is important too. For instance, sequence
    “A” — 20, 10, 40, 30, 60, 50, … — follows quite a different pattern
    from sequence “B” — 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, …. — even though they
    contain all the same numbers.</p>

    <p>In the first sequence, 30 is the 4th term, while in the
    second sequence, 30 is
    the 3rd term. To make this type of thing easier to write, we’ll
    introduce some notation.</p>

    <p>In the first sequence, we write “${A_4} = 30$” (pronounced
    “A sub four” or simply “A four”) to mean that the sequence’s
    4th term is 30. Then the first sequence is called $\{ {A_n}\}
    (because it is a set that consists of the terms ${A_1}$,
    ${A_2}$, ${A_3}$, etc) and the second sequence is called $\{
    {B_n}\} $.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Fill in the blanks according to the sequences above.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="a">. ${A_1}$=_____.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="b">. ${B_4}$=_____.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="c">. ${B_{\_\_\_\_}}$= 30.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="d">. ${A_{\_\_\_\_}}$= 70.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One last piece of notation you’ll need to know is that, in
    an arithmetic sequence, the constant difference between terms
    is often called “$d$”. In the sequence below, $d = 2$.</p>
    
    <p>7, 9, 11, 13, . . .</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In an arithmetic sequence called $\{ {T_n}\} $, if ${T_1}
      = 13$, and $d = 3$, then what does ${T_{10}}$ equal? What
      does ${T_{100}}$ equal?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In an arithmetic sequence, ${T_4} = 8$ and ${T_5} = 11$.
      Find the first three terms of the sequence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>An arithmetic sequence starts with ${T_1} = 4$, ${T_2} =
      9$, … Which term will equal 99?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What might the next two terms be in the sequence 4, 6, 9…?
      Find several different possible patterns.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make up five sequences all beginning with 1, 2, but with a
      different third term. Look at what others in your class came
      up with, as seeing different patterns can give you ideas for
      making up some really interesting sequences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the sequence 5, 10, 6, 12, 8, 16, 12, 24, ...</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="a">. Find the repeating pattern, and
      write the next 3 terms.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="b">. It looks like all of the numbers
      after the “5” are even —
      will the sequence ever produce another odd number?
      Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the three sequences below. Sequences $\{ {D_n}\}
      $ and $\{ {E_n}\} $ below have some missing information, but
      you can assume that they are arithmetic.</p>

    <p>You get a <em class="vocab">series</em> when you add up the terms 
      of a sequence.
    For example if you add the first four terms of
    $3,8,13,18,23,28,…$, you get the series
    $3 + 8 + 13 + 18$. In the following problems,
    you’ll develop clever ways to find the sum of a
    series without actually having to add every term
    individually — this way, if you have to add up a series that’s
    200 terms long, you won’t have to
    type 200 numbers into your calculator.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Think of ways you could add up the series $1 + 2 + 3 + ...
