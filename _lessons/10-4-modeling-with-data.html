    <p>Use your calculator to plot these data, with the Facebook
    population on the $y$-axis, and time in months on the $x$-axis.
    Then, try to predict how many people were on Facebook at the
    beginning of 2010.</p>

    <p>Looking at the data, it’s quite clear that the Facebook
    population has been growing over time, and it’s also pretty
    easy to see that the $rate$ at which it’s growing is
    increasing, too. Even if we take those two observations into
    account, though, there seems to be quite a wide range of
    plausible predictions in problem 1. It’s hard to know how to
    decide whether, say, 375 million users or 500 million users is
    the better prediction.</p>

    <p>What if we could find an equation that appeared to fit the
    existing data very well? In that case, we would have reason to
    believe that the equation was a good mathematical model for
    Facebook population growth, and we could therefore make more
    specific, confident predictions.</p>

    <p>If you’ve studied biology, you might have seen that
    exponential models are one of the simplest and most common
    types of models used for population growth. Even though
    Facebook isn’t quite same as, say, bacteria in a Petri dish, it
    turns out that these data indeed appear to exhibit exponential
    growth. Let’s find an exponential function that fits the data.
    Recall that, by definition, an exponential function has an
    equation in the form $y = a \cdot {b^x}$ , where a and b are
    constants.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>To find constants for our data, we’ll need to substitute
      two points into the general exponential equation, and then
      solve the resulting pair of equations for $a$ and $b$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. We have more points than we need:
      since there are only two constants to solve for, we actually
      only need two points. Which of the following pairs of points
      do you think we should use to get the best fit for the whole
      data set? Why?<br>
      <br>
      $\left( {12,1} \right)$ and $\left( {24,5.5} \right)$<br>
      <br>
      $\left( {24,5.5} \right)$ and $\left( {64,200}
      \right)$<br>
      <br>
      $\left( {36,12} \right)$ and $\left( {62,175}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. For each of the pairs of points in
      part a, find the equation of an exponential function that
      goes through the two points. Then, use your calculator to
      graph each of these three equations together with the actual
      data. Which one was the best fit? Which was worst? Why?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>Using whichever equation from problem 2 fit the data best,
      predict the Facebook population at the beginning of 2010.
      Compare your predictions to the actual data, available at:
      http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?timeline.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Jenn Jeffings, ecologist extraordinaire, has taken some
    data, shown below, on chestnut oak trees in the woods around
    her house. She used the house as home base, and counted the
    number of chestnut oaks within certain distances. So, for
    example, the second row in the table indicates that Jenn
    counted 63 chestnut oaks that were each no more than 10 meters
    away from the house. Plot these data using your calculator.</p>

    <table id="table-2" class="Basic-Table">

    <p>You can see clearly that, just as with the Facebook data,
    the $y$ values are increasing<br>
    at a faster and faster rate.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>Are the data exponential? Either use an equation and some
      algebra, or else work directly with the numbers to answer
      this question.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It turns out that Jenn’s tree data can be modeled accurately
    using a power<br>
    function, which is any function that can be described with an
    equation of the form $y = a \cdot {x^n}$ , where $a$ and $n$
    are constants.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>Strategically pick two points, and use them to solve for
      the constants $a$ and $n$. Check out the particular equation
      that results by graphing it on your calculator together with
      the data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>According to the model you made in problem 5, how many
      chestnut oaks are within 100 meters of Jenn’s house?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The equation you came up with in problem 5 is just one
    example of a power function. Let’s take a brief look at these
    functions in general.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="7">
      <p>Is the graph of $y = 5{x^2}$ exactly five times steeper
      than the graph of $y = {x^2}$ ? Is it exactly five times
      higher? Experiment with some values of $a$ other than 5, and
      see if you can get any different effects. In each case, it
      will be helpful to compare your graph to the more basic $y =
      {x^2}$ .</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="8">
      <p>Graph $y = {x^4}$ and $y = {x^5}$ on your calculator.
      Compare them to $y = {x^2}$ and $y = {x^3}$ . Now predict
      what $y = {x^{94}}$ and $y = {x^{95}}$ will look like.
      Check your prediction. What can you say in general about
      power functions where n is a positive integer?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="9">
      <p>Find the coordinates of a specific point that $must$ be on
      the graph of $y = 3{x^n}$ , regardless of the value of $n$.
      Then find one more.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Let’s go back to the Facebook data we looked at in the
    introduction. In problem 2, you should have seen that the
    equation $P = 0.637 \cdot {1.094^t}$ fit the data best. For
    consistency, let’s use that equation for the following
    problems.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>Suppose you were writing a $Postscript$ article about
      Facebook’s incredible exponential growth, and you wanted to
      include a prediction about when we would expect the Facebook
      population to reach 1 billion users. According to the
      equation, when will this happen?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="11">
      <p>According to the equation, how long will it be after your
      answer to the previous problem until the population reaches 2
      billion users? And how long after $that$ until it hits 4
      billion users?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="12">
      <p>Write an equation that expresses the time $t$, as a
      function of the population $P$. In other words, rewrite the
      equation $P = 0.637 \cdot {1.094^t}$ in “$t = $ ”
      form.</p>
    </div>

    <p>On the one hand, you could think of this equation as being
    the same as, or equivalent to, the original “$P = $ ”
    equation. On the other hand, though, it’s quite clear that in
    this equation, the “input” and “output” variables have been
    reversed. As you might recall from the lesson on algorithms,
    this means that the equation you wrote in problem 12 represents
    the inverse of the original function. (Actually,<br>
    they are inverses of each other.)</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="13">
      <p>Equations of the form $y = a{\log _b}\left( x \right) +
      c$ are called<br>
      logarithmic functions. If you haven’t already, use a bit of
      algebra to show that the equation you wrote in problem<br>
      12 is, indeed, a logarithmic function. Why does it make sense
      that the inverse of an exponential function would be a
      logarithmic function?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="14">
      <p>Below is a graph of the equation $P = 0.637 \cdot
      {1.094^t}$ .</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Using the graph above, and without
      using your calculator, make a large (at least half-page) and
      accurate graph of your equation from problem 12. (Remember
      that, typically, we put the output on the vertical axis and the
      input on the<br>
      horizontal axis.) What do you notice about the graph?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Plot your answers to problems 10 and
      11 both on the graph above and also on your graph.</p>

      <p>The data you’ve seen in the previous problem, as well as
      in problem 29, are examples of what’s called the “80-20
      rule,” or the<br>
      “Pareto principle.” Vilfredo Pareto, an economist in the late
      1800’s, made two oddly related observations: 80 percent of
      Italy’s wealth was owned by roughly 20 percent of the
      population, and 80 percent of the peas he harvested in his
      garden came from roughly 20 percent of the pea plants.
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle.)<br>
      <br>
      Since then, a surprising number of phenomena<br>
      have been discovered to follow this general rule. Here’s
      another example. The data set below comes from a study of how
      often different words appear in a large sample of English
      text. The first column represents a certain level of rarity
      or commonness for a word, and the second column shows how
      many words had appeared with that frequency.<br>
      So, for example, there were 586 words that appeared around
      200 times, whereas there were only 73 words that appeared 600
      times.</p>
