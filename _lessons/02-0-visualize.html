      <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
        <p>Why are manhole covers circular, instead of square?</p>
      </div>

      <p>You may have heard this “old chestnut” before. (If you
      have, don’t spoil it for everyone else!) If you haven’t, you
      may not have any idea how to even begin to think about the
      problem. Since this is a question about shapes, it may help
      to draw a picture. Better yet, you could build a model of the
      situation using, say, a cylindrical oatmeal box and a more
      rectangular box of cocoa powder. Now that you have a model,
      play around with it. Look at it from all different angles.
      Try placing the covers on the different “manholes.” Do you
      notice anything?</p>

      <p>There are many ways to visualize in solving a problem.
      Sometimes visualizing can be as simple as plotting several
      points on a graph and interpreting what you see. Visualizing
      can also involve altering or adding to a given picture to
      make the problem easier.</p>

      <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
        <p>How many square units are enclosed by the polygon
        DANCE
        below?</p>
      </div>

      <p>You may have divided the figure in the previous problem
      into triangles, or even “boxed it in” and found the area of
      the rectangles you’d created. Either way, the way you
      reconceived the diagram made it much easier to solve.</p>

      <p>In the problems that follow, one of two strategies will
      help you: 1) Draw or build a model of the
      situation to make it easier to understand. 2) Alter
      an existing diagram in some way to gain more
      information, or simply to help you look at the
      diagram in a different way.</p>

        <p>Below is the usual arrangement of 10 bowling pins, with
        the “single pin” at
        the bottom. By moving only 3 of the
        pins, can you “flip” the arrangement
        180 degrees so that the single pin is
        now at the top?</p>

        <p>Alice and Bruno work in a city where the streets are
        laid out in a grid pattern. City Hall is at (0,0). Alice
        and Bruno work at (–3,–1) and (3,3) respectively. They wish
        to find an apartment at a point C such that the sum of the
        distances each of them has to walk to work is a minimum. Of
        course, Alice and Bruno can’t walk “as the crow flies” —
        there are buildings in the way. So what they really mean
        when they talk about distance is the number of blocks
        they’d have to walk if they always stay on the
        sidewalk.
        At what place or places could point C be located to satisfy
        their requirements?</p>

        <p>Lawrence and Erika find a treasure map that tells them
        where precisely to begin in their search for booty, but
        then unfortunately it lists 5 directions and says to
        “follow them in whatever order will get you furthest from
        your starting position”. Here are the directions:
        
        10 Miles North
        30 Miles East
        $20\sqrt 2 $ Miles Northeast (that is, 45 degrees off from

        <p>Let’s try a more interesting one. The

        <p>Let’s look at the exciting, dramatic

        <p class="problem-part">. A bobsledder starts a race by
        going 100 miles South. He then goes 100 miles East, and
        then 100 miles North to complete the race. Amazingly, the
        end of the race is at the exact same place as the start of
        the race! How is this possible?</p>

        <p class="problem-part">. Is the starting place you came up
        with in part a the only possible correct answer? Explain
        why or why not.</p>

        <p>You have an 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper (standard

        bottom edge meet, and then unfold it. Now you cut it along
        the diagonal of the entire sheet of paper, and keep one of
        the triangular pieces.
        
        What’s the area of the piece of the triangle that’s above

        diagonal of the brick—the one that goes “inside” the brick

        you won’t be able to use
        the Pythagorean Theorem.)</p>

        <p class="problem-part">. Now, suppose you stacked three
        bricks on top of each other. Can you find

        <p>It is easy to cut a cylindrical piece of cheese into 4
        identical pieces with 2 straight cuts, and into 6 identical
        pieces with 3 straight cuts. One day, Mr. Trump decides to
        cut a cylindrical piece of cheese into 8 identical pieces,
        and unsurprisingly, it takes him 4 cuts.
        
        Rosie, his nemesis, claims she could have done it in only 3
        cuts! Was she telling the truth, or is she just trying to

        <p>A power of two is a number like 4, which is 22, or 64,

        says, “no way can you take that fishing rod on the bus —
        it’s five feet long, and we don’t allow any objects longer
        than four feet on this bus! Without the bus, Shelly is
        stranded, so she goes back to the store to return the rod.
        However, the clerk tells her that the rod is nonreturnable.
        In a flash of insight, Shelly comes up with a plan. She
        asks the clerk for a specific
        object, which he gives her, and sure enough, she is allowed
        on the next bus. Shelly’s plan didn’t involve breaking any
        laws, and it didn’t involve changing the rod in any way,
        certainly not by cutting or bending it, either! What was

        You measure the cylinder and find that it is 10 inches tall
        and 4 inches across. Then, to measure the length of the
        spiral, you cut up along the left side of the cylinder
        (imagine that it’s hollow, like the cardboard from a roll
        of toilet paper). Draw what the spiral would look like once
        you cut open the cylinder and flattened it
        into a rectangle — you can try this with an actual toilet
        paper roll or something similar.</p>
