    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Thales of Miletus (625-547 B.C.) is generally regarded as
    the first of the Seven Wise Men of antiquity. Among other
    things, he is known for having calculated the height of the
    Great Pyramid in Egypt using the length of its shadow when
    compared to a stick in the ground and its shadow at the same
    time of the day.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Inspired by Thales’ method, Robert and Mary calculated the
      height of a tree. At a certain time of day, Robert stood at a
      point such that the tip of his shadow coincided with the tip
      of the tree’s shadow. Then they measured both the shadow of
      Robert, who is 1.8 m tall, and the shadow of the tree. They
      found that Robert’s shadow was 4.32 m and the tree’s shadow
      was 18 m long. With this information they were able to
      calculate the height of the tree to be 7.5 m. Could you
      explain how they might have found the height of the tree?</p>

      <p><em class="vocab">Taking things apart</em> in the figure in Problem 1, we have
      two triangles. One right triangle whose legs are the tree and
      its shadow, and another right triangle whose legs are Robert
      and his shadow (see figure below). What can you conjecture
      about the angles in these two triangles? Explain your
      answer.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Kristi is sitting in the backseat of her parents’ car,
      driving from Omaha, NE to visit her grandparents in
      Hastings.
      The scale on her map is 1 inch = 20 miles. She’s using a
      Bazooka gum wrapper, which she knows is 1.5 inches long, to
      estimate distances.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">When leaving her parents’ garage,
      Kristi first opens the map, she notices that there are about
      five gum wrapper lengths from Omaha to Hastings. How many
      miles will her trip be?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many “gum wrapper lengths” will
      Kristi measure between her position on the map and Hastings
      if she is 100 miles away from Hastings?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Much later in the trip, Kristi
      notices that the distance remaining on the map is about a
      third of a gum wrapper. How many miles are remaining?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In Baltimore, Maryland, Union Memorial Hospital is the
      largest building in the triangular region bounded by E
      University Pkwy, N Calvert St, and E 33rd St (the higher on
      the map below). If the Union Memorial Hospital’s left side,
      the side on N Calvert St, is 250 meters long, use the map
      below to estimate the other two side lengths of this
      triangular region. You can either measure with a ruler or
      measure with some other object, like Kristi.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In Middle School, you may have learned how to scale down (or
    up) a figure.
    In fact, you may now realize that in doing dilations or
    contractions, you are changing the scale of a figure. When you
    scale a figure by a factor of $r$, your
    new figure will have lengths $r$ times the corresponding lengths
    of the original
    figure. This can also be expressed by saying that the sides of
    the second figure are <em class="vocab">proportional</em> to the corresponding sides
    of the first figure by a factor of $r$. In this case, we say as
    well that the second figure is a <em class="vocab">scaled copy</em> of the first
    figure by a factor of $r$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Below there are some pairs of figures. In Part b, the
      segments in each figure are perpendicular. Determine whether
      or not one is a scaled copy of the other. Explain.</p>

      <p>Two triangles are given in the picture below.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Take whatever measurements and do
      whatever calculations are necessary to check whether or not the

      <p class="problem-part">Based on your answer to Question (b),
      what can you conclude about $\angle B$ and $\angle E$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What can you say about the two other
      pairs of angles $\angle A$ and $\angle D$, and $\angle
      C$ and $\angle F$? Explain.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="problem">
      <p>Triangle $\triangle DEF$ is the image of under a dilation centered at the
      origin $O\left( {0,0} \right)$.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="../images/03-1-similar-triangles/image19.svg" >

      <p class="problem-part">Are triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ scaled copies of
      each other? If so, what is the scale factor? Explain.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How are the angles of triangle $\triangle ABC$
        related to the angles of <nobr>$\triangle DEF$?</nobr> Explain.</p>
    </div>


    <p>In our study of dilations, you may have noticed that the
    angles of the image of a figure under a dilation have the same
    measurements as the corresponding angles of the original
    figure. What’s more, you can see in Problem 7 that the
    following relationship holds:</p>

    <p>side length of image = (scale factor) $\cdot$ (side length of corresponding side in
    original figure)</p>

    <p>The next two problems use the important vocabulary word
    <em class="vocab">congruent</em>. Two angles are congruent if they have the same
    measure, just as two line segments are congruent if they have
    the same length.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Discuss the following statement with the members of your
      group.</p>
      <p>“If the three angles of a
      triangle are congruent to the three angles of a second
      triangle, then the triangles are scaled copies of each
      other.”</p>
      <p>If you disagree, give a
        counterexample showing that this statement is false.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now examine the following statement.</p>
      <p>“If two angles of a
      triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, then
      the triangles are scaled copies of each other.”</p>
      <p>If you disagree, give a
      counterexample showing that this statement is false.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The word <em class="vocab">similar</em> is used in mathematics to describe two
    triangles that are scaled copies of each other. Similarity
    plays an important role in the design of large or small objects
    such as automobiles, airplanes, or integrated circuits. As a
    matter of fact, before building an automobile, engineers sketch
    out scale drawings and use them to build scale models which
    they then use to run tests. Also, as we saw in the introduction
    of this section, Thales of Miletus may have used similar
    triangles to calculate the height of the Great Pyramid in
    Egypt, more than 2500 years ago. Similarity is thus a
    mathematical instrument that allows us to zoom in or zoom out
    when examining the physical world.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Thus far, you have discovered several features of similar
      triangles.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Why does it make sense to use the
      word “similar” to describe two triangles that are scaled
      copies of each other?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If two triangles are similar, how
      are their angles related? How are their sides related?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If you are given a $\triangle ABC$, describe a
      procedure for drawing a $\triangle A'B'C'$ similar to it.</p>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <p>In many of the problems that follow, you will see a
    convention that will be used throughout your high school
    career. If two angles are marked with arcs that are the same
    style (both bold, or double instead of single), that means
    those angles are congruent.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Calculate the lengths of the sides marked by small
      letters. Angles marked equally have the same angle
      measurement.</p>

    <h2>Further Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Jasmine has two triangles with equal angle
      measurements.</p>

      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/03-1-similar-triangles/image37.jpg" >
      </figure>
      <p>
      The sides of one triangle are 4, 6, and 8. The sides of the
      other are 9, 6, 12. She says that the triangles are not
      scaled copies because:</p>
      <p class="Development---Problem-Flow para-style-override-5">
      $\frac{4}{9} = 0.444...$, $\frac{6}{6}=1$ and $\frac{8}{{12}} =
      0.666...$</p>
      <p>Do you agree with Jasmine? Thoroughly explain your answer.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In two similar triangles, angles with the same measure are
    called <em class="vocab">corresponding
      angles</em>, and sides opposite corresponding angles are called
    <em class="vocab">corresponding sides</em>. As a matter of fact, in the previous
    problem, $\angle A$ and $\angle R$ are
    corresponding angles, and $\overline {BC}$ and $\overline {PQ}$ 
    are corresponding sides. Given
    misunderstandings such as that of Jasmine’s in the previous
    problem, it is
    important to state explicitly what pair of angles have the same
    measurement when describing similar triangles. A natural way of
    doing this is by listing their corresponding angles in the same
    order. Thus, regarding the triangles in the previous exercise,
    we say that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle RQP$ are similar, and write $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle RQP$. The symbol $\sim $ is read “is similar to.”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>$\triangle BUD \sim \triangle PAT$</p>
      <p>$BU = 7$, $UD = 8$,
      $BD = 10$, and $PT = 12$.</p>
      <p>Draw the figure and find
      $PA$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let $\triangle DEF \sim \triangle ABC$.</p>
      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/03-1-similar-triangles/image48.jpg" >
      </figure>

      <p class="problem-part">List all pairs of corresponding
      sides.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Let $k$ be the scale factor, that is,
      the lengths of the sides of $\triangle DEF$ are $k$ times the lengths of the
      corresponding sides of $\triangle ABC$. So, for example, $AB = k\cdot ED$. Write two more equations
      involving $k$, each one using a different pair of sides.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Solve each of the three equations for
      $k$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">In part c, you should have found
      three quantities that all equal $k$. Translate this into a
      statement about side lengths
      in similar triangles.</p>
      
    </div>

    <p>
    In the previous problem you may have concluded that if $\triangle DEF \sim \triangle ABC$,
    then</p>

    <p>$\frac{{DE}}{{AB}} = \frac{{EF}}{{BC}} =
    \frac{{FD}}{{CA}}$</p>

    <p>These equalities are also used to express that in two
    similar triangles corresponding sides are proportional. These
    equalities allow us to relate corresponding sides of similar
    triangles without explicitly mentioning the scale factor.
