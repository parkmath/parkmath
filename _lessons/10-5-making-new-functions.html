    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In the previous lesson, you used exponential, logarithmic,
    and power functions to model data. In modeling with exponential
    functions, for example, if you had evidence that the data could
    be modeled by an exponential function, then your task was to
    find values for $a$ and $b$ in the function type $f(x) = a{b^x}$.
    However, one problem involved a translated exponential
    function, for which it wouldn’t work simply to find a and b.
    Below is a graph of an equation fitting the data in problem 36
    concerning a cup of tea left to cool to room temperature.</p>

    <p>A function that does a decent job of modeling this data is
    $f(x) = 99.5{(.895)^x} + 71.$ You can think of the function as
    a translation
    of 71 units up of the more familiar function $g(x) =
    99.5{(.895)^x}$.</p>

    <p>It’s easy to imagine changing the vertical shift of g in
    order to produce lots of different functions, perhaps
    corresponding to cooling curves in rooms of different
    temperatures. More generally, in modeling data it’s useful to
    be able to start with basic function types and use
    transformations in order to control the shape and position of
    those graphs. We will begin our study of this technique by
    examining more abstract types of functions.</p>
    
    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Below is a graph of a function $f$. Note that $f$ is not one of
    the function types you have studied before. It does not have a
    nice formula. But its graph is still enough for you to answer
    questions about input and output.</p>

    <p>A table of values for the function might look like this:</p>

    <table id="table-1" class="Basic-Table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>x</p>
          </td>

          <td>1</td>

          <td>2</td>

          <td>3</td>

          <td>4</td>

          <td>5</td>

          <td>6</td>

          <td>7</td>

          <td>8</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>f(x)</p>
          </td>

          <td>---</td>

          <td>2</td>

          <td></td>

          <td></td>

          <td></td>

          <td></td>

          <td>5</td>

          <td>---</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Fill in the four missing values.
    
</p>
</div>

    <p>Note that we say “a table of values” “might” look like this
    because there are far more points on the graph of this
    function. If you wanted to, you could use $x = 3.5$ in the
    table, or even $x = \pi $. The dashes in the table are
    there because the function is not defined for certain inputs:
    specifically, for $x &lt; 2$ and $x &gt; 7$. Another way of
    saying this is that the domain of the function is $2 \le x \le
    7$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Using the same function f as in problem 1, draw the following
      graphs. If you need help getting started, remember that an
      expression like “$f(4) + 2$ ” means “two more than the value
      of $f(4)$.”

      
</p>
<p class="problem-part"> $y = f(x) + 2$</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> $y = \frac{1}{2}f(x)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> $y = - f(x)$</p>
    </div>

    <p>In Problem 2, you saw examples of a vertical translation, a
    vertical contraction, and a reflection in the $x$-axis.
    Horizontal transformations merit a little more attention.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Much as we can define the function $y = f(x) + 2$, we can
      define the function $y = f(x - 2)$.

      
</p>
<p class="problem-part"> Find the output of the function $y
      = f(x - 2)$ for the input $x = 5$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> Make a table of values with the
      headings x and $y = f(x - 2)$, and fill it in. Take care to
      think about which values of x it makes sense to use.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Using the values from your table in Problem 3, graph the
      function $y = f(x - 2)$. How was the graph of $y = f(x)$
      transformed to make this new graph?
    
</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      What is the domain of the function you graphed in
      Problem 4?
    
</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Conjecture a formula (like $y = f(x - 2)$ ) that translates
      the graph of $y = f(x)$ three units to the left. Then make a
      table and/or graph to see if you are right.
    
</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Now consider the function $y = f(2x)$. First find the output
      when $x = 2$. Then make a table of values with the headings
      $x$ and $f(2x)$, and fill it in. Take care to think about
      which values of $x$ it makes sense to use.
    
</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Using the values in your table from Problem 7, graph the
      function $y = f(2x)$. Describe the transformation of the
      graph of $y = f(x)$ this represents.
    
</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      What is the domain of the function you graphed in
      Problem 8?
    
</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Conjecture a formula that horizontally stretches the graph of
      $y = f(x)$ so that each point is three times farther away
      from the y-axis.
    
</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Use a similar process to graph $y = f(-x)$ . What transformation of the
      graph of $y = f(x)$ does this represent?
    
</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Find a formula for $f( - x)$ if $f(x) = {x^2} + 2x - 8$.
      Then sketch the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = f( - x)$ on the
      same axes.
    
</p>
</div>

    <p>Using transformations is one way to build a new function
    from a known function. You can also combine two functions to
    get a third.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Let $f$ be the function from the introduction (shown below, on
      the left), and $g$ be the function defined by the graph below,
      on the right.
    
</p>



<figure class="fig-50 two-up">
  <img src="parkmath/images/10-5-making-new-functions/Lesson 5 - graph 13 left.tif.jpg">
  <img src="parkmath/images/10-5-making-new-functions/Lesson 5 - graph 13 right.tif.jpg">
</figure>
      

<p class="problem-part"> The function $h$ is defined by the
      equation $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$.
      For example, to find the value of $h(3)$, you would
      add
      together the values of $f(3)$ and $g(3)$. Find $h(3)$, then sketch a
      graph of $h$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> Now sketch a graph of $j(x) = f(x) -
      g(x)$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The following exercise illustrates another way to combine
    functions, known as composition of functions. Composition is
    when you “chain” two functions together, by taking the output
    of one function and using it as the input to a second function.
    To see why this might be useful, consider the following
    situation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Howie is chewing Super-Bubble gum and blows a super-bubble.
      The radius (in inches) of his bubble increases with time (in
      milliseconds) in a way given by the equation $r(t) = 2t^{0.25}$. What is the
      volume of Howie’s bubble 5
      milliseconds after he blows it?
    
</p>
</div>

    <p>In order to solve the previous problem, you had to do two
    things. First, you had to find the radius of the bubble at 5
    milliseconds. Then you had to use the radius you found in order
    to find the volume of the bubble. In function language, if $V$ is
    the familiar function $V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi {r^3}$ giving the
    volume of the bubble in terms of the radius, then you first
    found $r(5)$, and then found $V(r(5))$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      
</p>
<p>Using the functions $r$ and $V$ as in the previous problem,</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> find $V(r(3))$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> find a formula, in terms of $t$, for
      $V(r(t))$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Let functions $f$ and $g$ be defined as in problem 13.

      
</p>
<p class="problem-part"> Find $f(g(3))$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> Find $g(f(3))$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> Find $f(g(5))$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> Sketch a graph of $g\left( {f\left(
      x \right)} \right)$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      The tribble population grows exponentially, and the level
      of the squeaky noise they collectively make is directly
      proportional to the size of their population. Let the tribble
  functions be defined as follows:</p>
      
      <p>$P$ outputs the tribble population at time $t$.</p>
      
      <p>$N$ outputs the noise level produced by a given number
        of tribbles.</p>
      
      <p>$D$ outputs the noise level given a time $t$.
    
</p>

      <p>Express one of these functions as a composition of the two others.</p>
      
    </div>

      points on the graph. Then, without using your calculator,
      graph the following equations, including the images of the
      three points you identified. If the asymptotes move away from
      the axes, indicate them with dashed lines.

    <p class="No-Paragraph-Style">You have been using the “inverse
    sine” function for years, but thinking about it now, you can
    see that the sine function does not have an inverse! There are
    many ways to get an output of 1: when x is 90°, 270°, 450°, etc
    if you are working in degrees, or when x is $\frac{\pi }{2}$,
    $\frac{{3\pi }}{2}$, $\frac{{5\pi }}{2}$, etc if you are
    working in radians. Thus, if someone says, “find ${\sin ^{ -
    1}}1$,” you wouldn’t know which of the values listed above to
    give in response.</p>

    <p class="No-Paragraph-Style">The reason we can still talk
    about the inverse sine function is that we are thinking about
    only a limited set of inputs (angles) that you can plug in to
    the function $f(x) = \sin x$. Limiting the allowable inputs in
    this way is called a domain restriction.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Use your calculator to take the inverse sine of some angles.
      Notice the kinds of outputs it gives you. Can you figure out
      exactly which angles belong to the restricted domain of the

      Trigonometric functions are not the only common functions
      that require a domain restriction in order to take their
      inverse. $f(x) = {x^2}$ does not have an inverse because for
      a given output, like 4, there are multiple inputs, -2 and 2,
      that produce that output. However, if you restrict the domain
      of f to allow only values of $x$ greater than or equal to zero,
      then the function has an inverse. You can think of the square
      root function as the inverse of $f(x) = {x^2}$ on this
      restricted domain.
