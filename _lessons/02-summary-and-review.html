      <p>We know that if we translate an object two units to the

      three units down first then two units right. In other words,
      we are confident that horizontal and vertical translations
      are commutative (the order in which things are done doesn’t
      matter). Are horizontal translations commutative with any
      other transformations that we have studied? For instance, are
      horizontal translations and dilations centered at the origin
      commutative? Investigate this and other possible combinations
