    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The graph of the sine and cosine functions are very
    distinctive looking.</p>

      
      
    
    <figure class="fig-50 two-up">

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Which of the figures above is $y = \sin x$? Which is $y =
      \cos x$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using your knowledge of trigonometry, find coordinates for
      a few of the high and low points for each graph, and of the
      places they cross the $x$-axis.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Though you’re used to using trigonometry to find missing
    angles and lengths in diagrams, the special shape of the graph
    of the sine and cosine functions make them very useful in
    modeling as well. Graphs that have a shape similar to that of a
      sine curve are called <em class="vocab">sinusoidal</em> (even if they involve the
    cosine instead of the sine).</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with some situations in which a graph with the
      characteristics of a sine or cosine curve would provide a
      good model.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In general, sine and cosine curves are used to model
      situations that are <em class="vocab">periodic</em>
    – that have some repeating pattern. (You might be familiar with
    this word from the periodic table, which is a chart of elements
    arranged so that, every time you begin a new row in the chart,
    the elements begin to repeat the same pattern of
    characteristics that was established in the previous row.) Sine
    and cosine functions are examples of periodic functions, and
    the distance you
    need to go on the $x$-axis before the values of the functions
      begin to repeat themselves is called the <em class="vocab">period</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the period of the sine function? How about the
      period of the cosine?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you are using radians, what is the period of each
      function?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Not all situations that are periodic will have the same
    period. Nor will all be the usual sine or cosine graphs. For
    example, one situation that lends itself well to trigonometric
    modeling is the depth of a lake at a fixed location,
    measured over time as the tide comes in and out. Here is a
    graph of some
    data for a particular lake. $D \left ( x \right )$ measures the depth of the water in
    inches
    at time $x$ hours after midnight.</p>

     <figure class="fig">
    <img src="../images/10-2-modeling-with-trig/Lesson%202%20-%20graph%205.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Though the shape of $D(x)$ is similar to that of a sine
    or cosine curve, clearly its equation is not $y = \sin x$ or
    $y = \cos x$. However, we can get the equation for this
    graph by doing various transformations of sine and cosine
    curves, much like we can take the graph of $y = {x^2}$ and
    use transformations to turn it into any parabola we choose. In
    order to figure out how to take a curve like $y = \sin x$ or
    $y = \cos x$ and turn it into the curve above, we’ll <em class="vocab">take
      things apart</em> by looking at each of the transformations
    separately.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Let’s first think about how we could change the period of a
    sine or cosine curve.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What type of transformation would changing the period be —
      a vertical stretch, vertical shift, horizontal stretch, or
      horizontal shift?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Suppose we wanted to cut the period of the sine function in
    half — make it $180^\circ$ instead of $360^\circ$. In other words, the sine
    function starts to repeat itself after $360^\circ$, but we want
    to find a different function that repeats itself after $180^\circ$. And put a third way (!) a partial table of values for
    the sine function looks like this …</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with a function that looks like $y = \sin x$ but
      has half the period. If necessary, try a few formulas and
      test your conjectures.</p>

      <p>Now try to find a formula for a function like the one
      above, except it has a period of $90^\circ$. Now find one with a
      period of $720^\circ$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In terms of $n$, what is the period of the function $y =
      \sin nx$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p class="problem-part"> Write an equation for a function related to the sine
      function that has period P.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> Does your idea work for cosine as
      well? Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>See if you can write an equation for a function that has
      the same period as the function in the tide example. You
      could pick either sine or cosine… for consistency, let’s use
      cosine.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In addition to the change in period, the tide function
    differs from the sine
    and cosine functions in other ways. For one thing, it is
    vertically stretched as compared to those functions.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the height of the usual cosine function, $y = \cos
      x$, measured from the $x$-axis to its highest point?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many times its normal height do you need to stretch a
      cosine curve in order to get the same height as the curve for
      the depth of water function, $D(x)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Conjecture an equation for a cosine-based function that
      would be vertically stretched by the right amount. If you’ve
      done it right and also changed the period, the graph of your
      function should be exactly the same shape as $D(x)$ .</p>
    </div>

    <p>The <em class="vocab">amplitude</em> of a sine or cosine curve is defined as <em>half</em> the vertical distance from the top to the bottom of the curve.
    This was the quantity you found in Problem 12.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why do you suppose the amplitude is defined as <em>half</em> the
      distance, rather than the entire distance from top to
      bottom?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the amplitude of $f(x) = \sin x$? What’s the
      amplitude
      of $D(x)$ ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an equation for a sinusoid curve that has amplitude
      A.</p>
    </div>

    <p>At this point, our graph has the right shape; we just need
    to translate it over to the right location. This is something
    you learned how to do when studying quadratics, though if
    you’ve forgotten, try experimenting with your calculator when
    answering the next few questions.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>By how much do we need to vertically shift the graph?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an equation for a graph with the same period,
      amplitude, and vertical shift as $D(x)$ (again using
      cosine).</p>
    </div>

    <p>We could make this graph coincide perfectly with $D(x)$
    by shifting it
    horizontally.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>To remind yourself how to do a horizontal shift, first try
      writing equations that shift the graph of $y = {x^2}$ three
      units to the right, then three units to the left.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now use the same technique to shift the graph of $y = \cos
      x$ 90 degrees to the right, then 90 degrees to
      the left.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>It’s not obvious how to do a horizontal shift at the same
      time that you change the period of a graph. First make a
      sketch of $y = \cos 90x$. Then write an equation that you
      could use to shift this graph two to the right. Check by
      using your calculator to graph your equation, and refine your
      equation if necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Determine the required horizontal shift needed to turn
      your graph in Problem 19 into the graph of $D(x)$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now that you have all the tools, write an equation for
      $D(x)$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Having this model allows us to make predictions. For
    example ...</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use your equation for $D(x)$ to predict the depth of
      the water at 10:15 pm.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find all of the times today that the water will have a
      depth of 65 inches.</p>
