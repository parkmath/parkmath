    <div class="problem">
      <p>Recall that the average speed of an object over a
      particular time interval is determined by the distance that
      it covers during that time period divided by the length of
      that time period. What was the average speed of the ball
      during the first second?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What was the average speed of the ball during the time
      interval from $t = 0.6$ to $t = 0.7$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What was the average speed of the ball during the time
      interval from $t = 0.7$ to $t = 0.8$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Approximately how fast was the ball going at $t = 0.7$ seconds?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Approximately how fast was the ball going at $t = 0.3$ seconds?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The average speed of the ball during the time interval $t =
    0.6$ to $t = 0.7$ should have been equivalent to calculating
    the change in the ball’s height divided by the amount of time
    during this change. In other words,</p>

    <p>
    ${\rm{average speed }} = {\rm{ }}\frac{{{\rm{change in
    height}}}}{{{\rm{time taken}}}} = \frac{{\left( {{\rm{final
    height}}} \right) - \left( {{\rm{initial height}}}
    \right)}}{{\left( {{\rm{final time}}} \right) - \left(
    {{\rm{initial time}}} \right)}}$|ִ| .</p>

    <p>While you may not have used this exact formula to do
    Problems 1-3, you
    probably used the reasoning encapsulated by the formula. But
    how did you
    arrive at an answer to Problem 4? Well, your answers to
    Problems 2 and 3
    give you estimates of the ball’s speed 1/10th of a second
    before $t = 0.7$ seconds and 1/10th of a second after $t = 0.7$ seconds. Since the ball probably didn’t make any strange
    movements right at $t = 0.7$(suddenly stop, suddenly jump up
    to 100 feet and instantaneously fall back to 25.16 feet, et
    cetera), then averaging your answers to Problems 2 and 3 would
    be a reasonable way of estimating the speed of the ball at $t =
    0.7$ seconds. This is just one way of trying to estimate the
    speed of an object at a particular time. We will look at a few
    other ways and also see how average speed (more generally known
    as average rate of change) relates to some other interesting
    concepts.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Let’s take another look at average speed and speed at a
    moment in time, this time by investigating an equation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Ben has a wicked fastball — wicked in that it speeds up as
      it moves toward the plate. A fairly reasonable model for this
      pitch is $d\left( t \right) = 130{\left( 2 \right)^t} - 130$, where $d\left( t \right)$ stands for the distance (in feet)
      that the ball has traveled since it left Ben’s hand after t
      time (in seconds).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What was the average speed of the
      ball during the time interval from $t = 0.1$ to $t = 0.2$?
      If you’re not sure what to do here then think about how you
      did Problem 1 and how you can get this problem to be more
      like Problem 1.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What was the average speed of the
      ball during the time interval from $t = 0.2$ to $t = 0.3$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">The calculation you performed in
      Part b can be seen as the slope of a specific line. Explain
      why this is true.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Below is shown a graph of $d\left(
      t \right) = 130{\left( 2 \right)^t} - 130$ over the time
      interval $0 \le t \le 0.5$. On the axes below, carefully,
      and as accurately as possible, draw the line referred to in
      Part c.
      Extend the line enough so that someone looking at your work
      can see that the line is different from the curve.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now, repeat what you did in Part d
      but draw the line that corresponds to the calculation you did
      in Part a. Make
      sure someone looking at your work can tell the difference
      between the lines.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Approximately what was the speed of
      the ball at $t = 0.2$ seconds?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">There is a line that just touches
      the graph of $d\left( t \right) = 130{\left( 2 \right)^t} -
      130$ at $t = 0.2$. This line does not pass through the
      graph. On the axes above, draw this line.
      Again, make sure to draw this line so that it can be seen
      to be different from the other two that you drew.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate as accurately as possible
      the slope of the line you drew in Part g. How does this slope
      compare to your answer in Part f?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate the speed of the ball at
      $t = 0.3$ seconds and then again at $t = 0.4$ seconds? Is the
      ball speeding up?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate the slope of the line that
      just touches the graph at $t = 0.45$. What does this number
      tell you about the ball?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The line that you drew in Problem 6 Part g is called a
    tangent line. By definition we say that the slope of a curve at
    a specific point is the slope of the tangent line at that
    point. So, the slope of the curve $d\left( t \right) =
    130{\left( 2 \right)^t} - 130$ at $t = 0.2$ is approximately 103.508. Also, since the variable graphed on
    the vertical axis
    is distance and the variable graphed on the horizontal axis is
    time, our slope calculation</p>

    <p>
    $\frac{{{d_2} - {d_1}}}{{{t_2} - {t_1}}} = \frac{{{\rm{change
    in distance}}}}{{{\rm{change in time}}}}$</p>

    <p>gives us the speed of the ball, 103.508 feet/second
    (approximately 70.6 mph).</p>

    <p>If we’re looking at a physical situation that involves
    distance versus time, we have seen how speed and slope of the
    curve are related. Let’s look at what more the slope of a curve
    can tell us.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph the function $y = {2^x}$ on paper over the interval
      $- 3 \le x \le 3$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate the slope of the curve at
      $x = - 2,\, - 1,\,\,0,\,\,1,{\rm{ and }}2$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How will the slope of the curve
      change as the value of x increases beyond the value of $x =
      2$? How will it change as the value of x decreases from $x =
      - 2$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Use your calculations in Part a to
      explain why $y = {2^x}$ is not a linear function.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph the function $y = {0.7^x}$ on paper over the
      interval $- 3 \le x \le 3$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Calculate $\frac{{{{0.7}^{2.001}} -
      {{0.7}^2}}}{{2.001 - 2}}$ and explain the meaning of this
      number in the context of this problem.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is it reasonable to think of your
      calculation in Part a as an estimate of the slope of the
      curve at $x = 2$? How can you get an even better
      estimate?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate the slope of the curve at
      $x = - 2,\, - 1,\,\,0,\,\,1,{\rm{ and }}2$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an expression that would
      represent an estimate of the slope of the curve at x = b.
      This expression should have b along with some constants.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Looking back at your solution to
      Part d, for what value(s) of x is the slope of the curve less
      than -1?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Are there any values for x for
      which the slope of the curve is 0? You might visualize what
      the tangent line would look like in order to solve this
      problem.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Your work in Problems 7 and 8 should have given you some
    idea of how you can use the slope of a curve to determine
    whether the curve is linear. Also, how the slope of the curve
    changes can give you some sense of what is happening to the
    curve.</p>

    <p>We will add only one thing more to our understanding of the
    slope of the curve.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A rabbit population is growing according to the model
      $R(t) = 200{(1.02)^t}$, where t is measured in days.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate the slope of the curve at
      t = 3. What does this number tell you about the rabbit
      population? Be specific.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">At what rate (rabbits/days) is the
      population increasing
      at 6 days?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the daily percentage growth
      rate of the rabbit
      population?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Why are your numerical answers to
      Parts a, b, and c all
      different from each other?</p>
    </div>

    <p>As you may have surmised from the previous problem, “growth
    rate” is a
    somewhat ambiguous term: you need to know whether the rate is a
    percentage growth rate (your answer to Part c and the number
    that is built into the model) or an absolute growth rate (your
    answers to Parts a and b). Moreover, the slope of the curve
    tells you how two quantities change with respect to each
    other,
    not necessarily how one quantity changes with respect to
    itself, which is what percentage change has to do with.</p>

    <p>Throughout the problems in this section and the next, you’ll
    need to pay close attention to the information presented,
    particularly what is implied by the information. For example,
    when you’re told that the ball has hit the ground, this should
    mean to you that its height is zero, and you can bring this
    information into your calculations. Thinking carefully about
    the implications of the terms and information in a problem is
    part of our habit
    re-examine the problem and will come in handy in solving many
    problems.</p>

      <p>Speed and velocity are not synonyms. “What?!” you say.
      Velocity is speed with direction. For example, if you go
      forward with a velocity of 5 yd/sec, stop, and then go
      backwards with a speed of 3 yd/sec, your velocity while going
      backwards was -3 yd/sec, where the negative merely
