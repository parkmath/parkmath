    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The escalator at the Wheaton metro station in Silver Spring,
    Maryland, is the longest escalator in the Western Hemisphere.
    If you ride it you will travel a diagonal distance of 508 feet,
    which will take two minutes and forty-five seconds. You’re
    about to build a bigger one – your goal is to make an escalator
    with a diagonal distance of 520 feet. Before you can start,
    though, you need to do some planning. You need to figure out
    how much space along the ground your escalator will take so
    that you can prepare the foundation. Standard escalator
    construction rules require that:</p>
    
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>the steps each be 1.2 feet long.</li>
      <li>The measure of the angle between the ground and the
      diagonal path of the escalator must be no more than 30°</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You start to build your escalator and measure a diagonal
      distance of 1.3856 feet per step. What is the horizontal
      distance, along the ground, you’ll need to clear in order to
      build your escalator with a diagonal distance of 520
      feet?</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Your solution to the escalator problem probably involved
    ratios or scale factors in some way. Here’s one way of thinking
    about the problem:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you haven’t already, explain how you know that
      $\frac{1.2}{1.3856} = \frac{\textrm{the
      required horizontal distance}}{520}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use a similar method to find the height of the Wheaton
      escalator.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Imagine a large right triangle $ABC$ with the right angle at
      $A$ and angle $C = {30^ \circ }$. Based on your work in
      problems 1-3:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What would you expect the ratio of
      $AC$ to $BC$ to be? Why?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about the ratio of $AB$ to
      $BC$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Go ahead and check your thinking by
      using a protractor and ruler to accurately draw such a
      triangle, and measure the sides. Convince yourself that these
      ratios are the same no matter how large or small the right
      triangle is, provided the measure of angle $C$ remains
      30°.</p>
    </div>

    <p>As problem 4 emphasizes, certain ratios will always stay
    constant in a right triangle with an angle measuring 30°. In
    the escalator example, the ratio of the vertical distance to
    the diagonal distance is called the <em class="vocab">sine</em> of 30°. The ratio of
    the horizontal distance to the diagonal distance is called the
    <em class="vocab">cosine</em> of 30°.</p>

    <p>A third ratio is called the <em class="vocab">tangent</em> ratio. In the escalator
    example, this is the ratio of the vertical distance to the
    horizontal distance.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you asked your calculator to tell you the sine of 30°
      what do you suppose it would give you? How about the cosine
      of 30°? Tangent of 30°?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you think of the escalator as a triangle with a 30° angle and a 90° angle, you can label the sides as
    follows:</p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/Intro Trig image after problem 5.png">
    </figure>

    <p>There are two sides that form the 30° angle. One is of
    course the <em class="vocab">hypotenuse</em>; the other is called the side <em class="vocab">adjacent</em> to
    the 30° angle. The vertical side of the triangle is called
    the side <em class="vocab">opposite</em> to the 30° angle, since it is all the way
    across the triangle from the angle.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For each of the following, use a protractor to draw a
      RIGHT triangle with the angle given. Then use a ruler to
      measure the lengths and calculate the sine, cosine, and
      tangent of each angle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">25°</p>

      <p class="problem-part">63°</p>

      <p class="problem-part">42°</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For each part in the previous problem, use the SIN, COS,
      and TAN buttons on your calculator to see how close your
      estimates were.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Here’s the picture in general. We’re using $\theta$ (“theta”) to
    stand for any angle, just like we can use $x$ to stand for any
    number.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/intro%20trig%20def%20triangle.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p>If $\theta$ is an angle in a right triangle, but not the right
    angle, then here’s how we define the three trigonometric
    ratios:</p>

    <p>Sine of $\theta$= opposite/hypotenuse</p>

    <p>Cosine of $\theta$= adjacent/hypotenuse</p>

    <p>Tangent of $\theta$= opposite/adjacent</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the two triangles below, find the sine, cosine, and
      tangent of a 70° angle, a 20° angle, a 35° angle, and a 55°
      angle.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Did you notice any repeated answers in your calculations
      above?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Make a conjecture based on your
      findings.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Try out your conjecture on a
      triangle that you create.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can you explain why this is going
      on?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the similar triangles lesson, and also in the escalator
    problem, you were able to find missing lengths in certain
    triangles because you had a second, similar triangle that
    allowed you to find the scale factor. One reason that sine,
    cosine, and tangent ratios are so important is that they help
    you find lengths in triangles even when you don’t have a second
    triangle to help you get the scale factor.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here is a problem that allows you to “solve a triangle”
      using only trigonometry.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Use this triangle to write an
      expression for the tangent of
      35 degrees. Your expression will, of course, contain the
      letter $x$.</p>

      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/intro%20trig%20solve%20triangle%20w.tif.jpg" >
      </figure>
      
      <p class="problem-part">Using the equation “$\tan {35^ \circ
      } = ...$”, find $x$. (You should know the value of $\tan
      35^\circ $ from a previous problem)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find the length of the hypotenuse of
      the triangle.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In the previous problem, you were lucky that you already
    knew the tangent of 35°. You are not always so lucky.
    However, your calculator can help you out.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Press the MODE button on your calculator and make sure
      “degree” is selected. Then type “tan(35)”. The number on your
      screen should look familiar.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find both of the missing sides in the following
      triangle:</p>
      <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/find%20both%20missing%20sides.tif.jpg" >
      </figure>
    </div>


    <p>Often, trigonometry is used to find lengths of triangles in
    the “real world” that are too difficult to measure
    directly.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You’d like to know how tall a flagpole is, but you can’t
      reach the top to measure it. So instead you use your tape
      measure to measure 50 ft along the ground. Standing 50 ft
      away from the flagpole, you can see the top of the flagpole
      by looking up at a 22° angle. How tall is the flagpole?</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/intro%20trig%20flagpole2.tif.jpg" >
      </figure>
    </div>


    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the previous problem, you might have ignored your
      height. Say your eyes are at a level of 5 feet 6 inches above
      the ground. Taking this into account, figure out how tall the
      flagpole <em>really</em> is.</p>

    <p class="new-column">Your calculator gives you approximate answers when you ask
    it to tell you the sine, cosine, or
    tangent of an angle. (See <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html">http://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html</a>
    for more information and a juicy, though probably apocryphal,
    tidbit.) Sometimes you would rather know the answer
    exactly. Some geometry can help you do this.</p>

      <p>The following questions are related to a famous puzzle
      called “Buffon’s needle,” which you may want to look up if
      you
      are interested.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">You’re throwing a tiddlywink with a
      4 cm radius onto a floor with square tiles measuring 12 cm on
      a side. What’s the probability that the tiddlywink will make
      it onto the floor without landing on a crack?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now you’re playing a different
      version of the game, where you throw a needle between evenly
      spaced stripes on the floor. Your needle is 2 inches long,
      and the stripes are also 2 inches apart. Assuming that the
      needle will land at an angle of 72 degrees to the stripes,
      what’s the probability that it will land without overlapping
      any of the stripes?</p>

      <p>Here are some questions about an
      “extreme value” of the sine.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Ask your calculator to tell you the
      sine of an 80° angle. Then ask for the sine of an 89° angle.
      Does this suggest a value for the sine of a 90° angle? Have
      your calculator confirm your guess.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Using a protractor, draw a right
      triangle with an 80° angle. Then measure the hypotenuse and
      the side opposite the 80° angle. How do they compare? How do
      you think those two sides would compare in a right triangle
      with an 89° angle?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Have a conversation with a
      classmate (or friend, guardian, spiritual advisor) about how
      someone might have decided what the sine of a 90° angle
      should be. Remember that our definition of sine as
      $\frac{{{\rm{opposite}}}}{{{\rm{hypotenuse}}}}$ in a right
      triangle won’t quite work.</p>

      <p>Play the “Buffon’s needle” game: take a needle and draw
      parallel lines on a sheet of paper, spaced the needle’s
      length apart. Toss the needle so that it lands on the paper,
      and record whether the needle crosses a line or not. Pool
      your data with others who have played the game, and use the
      data to compute the probability that a needle thrown on the
      paper will cross a line. Once you have the probability, try
      dividing by two and then taking the reciprocal of your
