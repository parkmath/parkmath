    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>An ecologist is studying moose herds, to see if hunting
      practices are depleting the herds. In each herd, every year,
      $\frac{1}{3}$ of the population reproduces (1 baby moose
      each). Every fall, though, after the moose reproduce, hunters
      are allowed to hunt down 100 moose. In one herd, at the
      beginning of the study there are 270 moose. What would be the
      size of the herd population after 5 years? (Each year, round
      to the nearest moose.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>The situation above is an example of recursion — a process
    in which the input at any particular stage depends on the
    output of a previous stage (or previous stages). In this
    particular case the size of the herd in any given year is
    dependent on its size the year before.</p>

    <p>If you understand exactly how the stages are related you can
    then express that relationship with an equation, called a
    recursive equation. These equations
    will allow you to model and track changes in all sorts of
    populations — people, wildlife, bacteria, viruses, radioactive
    material and a host of others. People who use these powerful
    tools are interested in essentially three important questions:
    Will the population continue to increase without bound, will it
    level off at a
    certain number, or will it disappear after a certain
    period?</p>

    <p>Here is another example of a recursive process.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Enter any number greater than 1 in your calculator and
      find its square root. Then find the square root of your
      answer. Continue finding square roots of previous answers
      until something interesting develops. Do you think the same
      thing would happen with any number greater than 1 that you
      choose? How about any positive number less than 1?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A bacteria colony is placed into a Petri dish along with a
      bacteria-eating fungus. Every day, the bacteria population
      increases by 50%, but during the night at midnight, the
      fungus devours 50 bacteria.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Draw a chart and track the bacteria
      population over the next week, if the initial population is
      120:</p>

    <p class="problem-part">A smaller colony would have a hard
    time surviving in the same dish as the fungus. Find an initial
    population size that would cause the population to drop
    quickly. Draw a chart for this situation. You can assume that
    if at the end of a day there are less than 50 bacteria left,
    the fungus will simply eat all the bacteria that are left.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Find an initial population size that
    would cause the population to decline slowly. Draw a chart for
    this situation.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Is there a population size that would
    remain unchanged despite the bacteria-eating fungus? (In this
    sort of outcome, the system is said to be in a state of
    equilibrium, or in a steady state.)</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Explain how you could figure out
    ${B_n}$, the number of bacteria after n days, by knowing the
    population in the dish one day earlier. Write an equation for
    ${B_n}$ in terms of ${B_{n - 1}}$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Is there a number such that if the
    population size falls below that number, the colony will
    eventually die out?</p>

    <p>The equation you wrote in problem 3e is a recursive
    equation. To fully describe a recursion process one would write
    the recursion equation together with the initial condition. In
    the case of problem 3e, for example, we would write ${B_n} =
    \frac{3}{2}{B_{n - 1}} - 50$ as well as ${B_0} = 120$ r . In
    mathematics, the subscript zero is sometimes used to represent
    the amount or number you started with.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A buyer and seller are bargaining over the price of an
      antique lamp. First, the buyer offers to pay \$400. Next, the
      seller makes a counter-offer — she’ll sell it for $800.
      Trying to be fair, the buyer decides to average those two
      prices for his next offer of \$600. Also trying to be fair,
      the seller then averages the two most recent prices, to make
      her next offer. They continue bargaining, each using the
      averaging method to come up with their next offer.</p>

      <p>Sweden and Croatia are locked in an
      escalating arms race. Every year, one of the countries builds
      some bombs and missiles, and then inevitably, the next year,
      the other country builds even more to compensate. In each
      country, the Department of
      Defense has the following strategy:</p>

      <p>For every new bomb that the enemy built last year, we’ll
      build 2 new bombs. For every new missile that the enemy built
      last year, we’ll build 2 new missiles, AND a new bomb.</p>

<p>      Neither country can afford the expense of this pointless arms
      race, and each one claims that the other country started the
      whole situation by building the first few weapons.</p>

    triangles. In the second iteration, the process is repeated.
    Each old segment is replaced with four new segments, each of

      <p>One of the simplest models for population growth is based
      on the idea that the growth rate of the population is
      proportional to the current size of the population. So, for
      example, we might expect that, each year, the number of frogs
      in a pond will increase by 6% every year.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write a recursive equation for this
      model of growth.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The population model you looked at in the previous problem
      has a major limitation: it doesn’t take into account the fact
      that the frogs in the pond have a limited number of resources
      (food, lily pad real estate, etc.). The following equation,
      called
      the logistic model of population growth,
      attempts to take this into account:</p>

      <p>${F_{n + 1}} = {F_n} + 1.1{F_n} \cdot \left( {\frac{{40 -
      {F_n}}}{{40}}} \right)$̔#~ .</p>

<p>      The idea here is that, the pond has a “carrying capacity” of
      40 frogs — i.e., it has enough resources for 40 frogs to live
      healthily. So, while the population’s growth rate is
      proportional to the current population size, it is also
      proportional to how close the population is to the carrying
      capacity.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Suppose that there were 15 frogs in
      the pond. According to the equation, how much would the
      population change the next year? How about if there were 35
      frogs in the pond?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Does it seem plausible that this
      system (unlike the one in the previous problem) would have an
      equilibrium solution other than 0?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Starting with an initial population
      of 2 frogs, use the equation above to track the frog
      population over several years. What happens in the long
