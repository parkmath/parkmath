    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>An explorer is lost in the 30 by 60 mile rectangular section
    of snowy wilderness shown below. The search and rescue team
    knows that she started her journey at the southwest corner, and
    since there hasn’t been any new snow for a while, they also
    know that they’ll be able to see her tracks.</p>
    
 <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/09-1-algorithms/Wilderness.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Obviously, the team wants to find the lost explorer as
    quickly as possible. There are different ideas about how to do
    this, though, so they decide to split into
    two groups. Group A will start at the southwest corner and
    simply follow the explorer’s trail. Group B, though, has a
    different strategy. Here’s what they do:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Group B starts out at $\left( {0,30} \right)$, and
      walks directly east. Every
      time they cross the explorer’s trail, they make a note of it.
      Suppose that by the time they reach the eastern border,
      they’ve crossed the explorer’s trail 5 times. What can they
      conclude about where the explorer must be now? How about if
      they’d crossed the trail 8 times?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>As you can see, Group B’s west-to-east walk allows them to
      cut the remaining search area in half. Their idea is to keep
      repeating this until they’ve narrowed down the search area to
      a small horizontal strip. Suppose that on the first walk
      (along $y = 30$), they crossed the trail 3 times.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What horizontal line should they
      walk next?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now, suppose that on the second
      walk, they cross the
      explorer’s trail 6 times. Where could the explorer possibly
      be? Demonstrate your answer by drawing a picture of one such
      trail the explorer could have taken.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem allow-break">

      <p>Is Group B’s strategy better than Group A’s? To help you
      answer this question, determine approximately how long each
      one would take to find the lost explorer in each of
      the following scenarios. (Assume that each group moves at the
      same speed, and that as soon as a group comes within
      a mile or so, they’ll see the explorer’s signal flares.)</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>The two strategies in the situation above are both examples
      of <em class="vocab">algorithms</em>— though, of course, Group A’s is a rather
    simple one. An <em class="vocab">algorithm</em> is simply a clearly defined,
    step-by-step process for accomplishing a desired task. You can
    think of every algorithm as having three main parts: input,
    process and output. In the search and rescue situation, for
    example, the input would be the whole search area and the
    explorer’s trail, and the output would be the explorer’s
    location.</p>

    <p>As you can hopefully see, thinking about and analyzing
    algorithms can be
    useful in situations where there are multiple possible
    approaches, and we want the “best” or most efficient one. But
    this kind of thinking isn’t only useful in practical
    applications — it’s also a source of some classic games and
    puzzles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The Number Devil is thinking of an integer between 1 and
      63 (inclusive), and your job is to guess it. If you guess
      wrong, the Number Devil will tell you (truthfully) whether
      your guess is too low or too high. Come up with a strategy
      for finding the Number Devil’s number in as few guesses as
      possible.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Was there anything in common between your strategy in the
    previous problem and Group B’s approach to finding the missing
    explorer? Group B’s strategy — and, likely, yours — is an
    example of a <em class="vocab">binary search</em> algorithm. (The Latin root $bini$ means “two-by-two”.) Here’s another application of it.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your English teacher has an alphabetized stack of 15
      papers,
      but she’s forgotten whose papers she collected. Now, she
      needs to check and see if she has Gabi’s paper in the stack.
      She decides to use a binary search algorithm.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Simulate this with your group: have
      a group member make an alphabetized list of names without
      showing you. The list maker gets to decide whether or not
      “Gabi” is in the list. You, in the role of the teacher, can
      ask for any individual name in the list (e.g., “Who is the
      fifth person in the list?”). How many times do you have to
      ask before you can be sure whether or not Gabi’s name is in
      the stack?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Make up an alphabetized list of 15
      names that would
      force the teacher’s binary search process to make the most
      guesses possible. This is called a “worst case” input for
      the
      algorithm. How many guesses does the algorithm take,
      in the worst case?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now, you decide to play a little trick on the teacher.
      Carefully rearrange the ordering of names you made in part
      b of the previous problem so that, when your teacher uses
      binary search, she’ll end up mistakenly concluding that
      Gabi’s paper is not in the stack.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Based on what happened in problem 6, it’s clear that there
    are certain situations in which the binary search algorithm
    isn’t appropriate. This is always true: every algorithm makes
    some assumptions about its input.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What assumption(s) did the teacher make in using her
      binary search algorithm?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">In addition to thinking carefully about the input, it’s also
    helpful when working with algorithms to identify the <em class="vocab">basic operations</em> your algorithm can use. The basic operations are
    always based on the situation you’re dealing with: they are
    the
    actions you’re able to do as a single “step” of your algorithm.
    In the Number Devil game, for example, your basic operation was
    to guess a number and find out if it was correct, too big, or
    too small. In the stack of papers example,
    the basic operation was to check the name on a single paper in
    the stack and compare it alphabetically with the name ‘Gabi’.
    The basic operation in the
    following game is similar to these two, but slightly
    different.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Play the following game with a classmate:</p>
    

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Your partner should write
    five different numbers on slips of paper. Then shuffle the
    papers and put them face down on the table in a straight
    row.</p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">You are the guesser. Your
    job is to figure out which paper has the largest number written
    on it. But you can never
    see the numbers themselves — you can only ask for
    comparisons. For example, you could point to the first
    slip and the fourth slip, and your classmate would have
    to tell you which one has the larger number.</p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Each comparison counts as
    one step, and your goal is to find the paper with the largest
    number with as few steps as possible.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Play the game and identify the paper
    with the largest
    number. How many steps did it take before you were
    certain about your answer?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Describe, in detail, an algorithm for
    finding the largest
    number in a list of numbers, using as few comparisons
    as possible.</p>
      
      </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Aaron has an algorithm that he claims can find the largest
      number every time using only three comparisons. Either figure
      out Aaron’s algorithm, or explain why it’s impossible.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Here’s a somewhat different algorithmic puzzle that many
    consider a “modern classic.” (In fact, the story goes that,
    before it got out onto the Internet, this was a question that
    Google interviewers asked of potential employees.)</p>

    <p>You have two perfectly identical eggs. You need to figure
    out how high an egg can fall from a 100-story building before
    it breaks. You know nothing about the toughness of the eggs;
    they may be very fragile and break when dropped from the first
    floor. On the other hand, they may be super tough genetically
    altered eggs, so tough that that dropping them from the 100th
    floor doesn’t even cause a scratch. The only thing you know for
    sure is that they both have exactly the same “toughness.”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Joey takes his first egg, and drops it off of the fourth
      floor. It doesn’t break. Then, he goes up and drops it off
      the tenth floor, and it shatters spectacularly on the
      sidewalk. Finally, he takes his second (and last) egg, and
      drops it off the seventh floor. It breaks. What can Joey
      conclude about the toughness of his eggs?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with a strategy for figuring out your eggs’
      toughness. Your job is to guarantee the smallest
      number of egg-drops, in the worst case. You are
      allowed to break both eggs, but remember, two is all
      you get!</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="new-page">Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You have 16 identical-looking coins. Fifteen of them have
      exactly the same weight, and one is too heavy. Describe
      an algorithm for finding the heavy coin in as few steps as
      possible. The basic operation allowed is to use a simple
      balance to compare 2 piles of coins to see which pile is
      heavier.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the algorithm you use for adding two very large numbers
      by hand, what are the basic operations? How about multiplying
      two numbers by hand? Dividing?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Describe the mental algorithm a street vendor might
      use
      to quickly make change for a $\$20$ bill. Make sure your
      algorithm works by testing it out the following sale amounts:
      $\$1.50$, $\$3.00$, $\$11.45$, $\$17.26$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an algorithm for finding someone’s age based on
      their birth date and the current date. (For instance, Tom’s
      birth date is 6/14/90 and today’s date is …. so Tom is ….
      years old.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Recall the Number Devil game from problem 4. Now let’s say
      you’re trying to guess a number between 1 and 255. If you
      were going to play using the binary search algorithm, what
      would be one worst-case number that the Number Devil could
      choose?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the following strategy to the egg-drop
      problem:</p>
  
    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow"><em>Starting at floor 1,
    drop the first egg off of odd-numbered floors until it breaks.
    Then, go back down one floor and drop the second egg. If it
    breaks, that’s the answer. If not, then the floor above is the
      answer.</em></p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Say you get to decide how
    tough the eggs are, and you want to force the strategy above to
    make the largest possible number of drops before it
    succeeds.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What is the worst-case
    input for this strategy?
    i.e., how tough should you make the eggs?</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> What’s the worst-case
    number of drops?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <p>The algorithms we’ve worked with so far dealt with lists of
    information, whether they were lists of numbers, names, phone
    numbers, etc. Now, we’re going to look at algorithms that
    transform a single item, such as a number, word, etc.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You and your friend are planning to share lockers, so as
      soon as you get your combinations, you plan to exchange them
      over the phone. Each combination has three numbers in it –
      for example, 11 – 2 – 41.</p>

      <p>In case someone might be listening, though, you agree ahead
      of time to use the following algorithm to encrypt each number
      in the combination:</p>

      <p>      ${\mathop{\rm EncryptNumber}\nolimits} \left( N \right)$:</p>
      <p>If $N$ is odd, then output $2 + N$.<br>
      Otherwise, output $2 \cdot N$.</p>
 

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Notice that the notation
    being used here is similar to the “function notation” that
    you’ve seen in some previous
    lessons. “EncryptNumber” is the name of the algorithm, and $N$ is
    a name for the input to the algorithm.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Your combination is 12 – 7 – 11. What
    should you tell
    your friend?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Your friend tells you 80 – 28 – 29.
    What was her
    combination?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your brother wants to use the same system with his friend,
      but he’s confused about how it’s possible to “decrypt” the
      numbers he receives. Give him detailed instructions for a
      “DecryptNumber” algorithm that he can use to understand what
      his friend tells him.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One convenient feature of using function notation is that we
    can use it to easily write down things about what an algorithm
    does for specific inputs. For example, we can write
    ${\rm{EncryptNumber}}\left( 4 \right) = 8$, or
    ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( 8 \right) = 4$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {13} \right)$? How
      about ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {24} \right)$? And
      ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {18} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Predict what would happen if you applied the EncryptNumber
      algorithm to each of your three answers in the previous
      problem. Then try it out to test your prediction.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When you use an algorithm to encode a message so that no
    strangers can understand it, it’s called an “encryption”
    algorithm. This is essentially what a computer does when you
    enter a password or other personal information on a website, so
    that nobody besides the website owner can see it.</p>

    <p>Another kind of encoding is called “compression”. With
    compression, the idea is to shrink the size of a message down
    so it’s faster to transport. This is why mp3’s are such a big
    deal: they allow you to compress very large song files so that
    they’re small enough to download quickly.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Emmett wants to compress all the old emails he’s saved on
      his computer. Thinking of the shorthand he sometimes uses for
      text messages, he decides to go through each message and
      remove all the vowels and all the spaces. One problem with
      this approach is that it simply doesn’t shrink the message by
      all that much. However, there’s a much deeper problem. What
      is it? Can you suggest an alternative method for compressing
      Emmett’s emails?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What are some characteristics that would make a good
      compression algorithm? What characteristics are absolutely
      necessary?</p>
    </div>

    <p>You saw with the compression and encryption algorithms above
      that they’re only useful if they also have <em>de</em>compression and
      <em>de</em>cryption algorithms to go with them. These are two examples
      of a more general type of algorithm called an <em class="vocab">inverse</em>
      algorithm. When you have two algorithms, and each one reverses
      the other, then the two algorithms are called <em class="vocab">inverses</em> of each
    other. Using this language, we can say the major flaw in
    Emmett’s compression algorithm was that it has no inverse
    algorithm. (Why not?)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You want to share your gym locker with a different friend
      from the one in problem 18. But she and your other friend
      don’t get along, so you need a different code for this
      locker. Here’s the one you use:</p>

    <p class="Narrative-Block">${\mathop{\rm GymCode}\nolimits}
    \left( N \right)$:<br><br>

    If $N$ is odd, then output $2N$.<br>
    Otherwise, if $N$ is a multiple of 4, output $N + 1$.<br>
    Otherwise, output $2N + 3$.</p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Write an inverse for this
    algorithm called GymDecode.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Now, let’s say you wanted to write down all your passwords
    so you don’t forget them. Since someone else might see the
    paper, you decide to encrypt all the
    passwords so that only you will know what they really are.</p>

    <p>You’ve already got two encryption algorithms: EncryptNumber
    from problem 18 and GymCode from problem 24. So you can just
    combine the two to create the SuperSecretCode algorithm, as
    follows:</p>

    <p class="Narrative-Block">${\mathop{\rm
    SuperSecretCode}\nolimits} \left( N \right)$:<br>
      
    Output ${\mathop{\rm EncryptNumber}\nolimits} \left(
    {{\mathop{\rm GymCode}\nolimits} \left( N \right)} \right)$.</p>

    <p>Recall that ${\mathop{\rm GymCode}\nolimits} \left( N
    \right)$ just means “the output of GymCode when you
    input $N$”. Similarly, “${\mathop{\rm EncryptNumber(GymCode}\nolimits} \left( N
    \right))$” means, “the output
    of EncryptNumber when you input ${\mathop{\rm
    GymCode}\nolimits} \left( N \right)$”.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the value of ${\mathop{\rm

      first
      figure out the value of ${\mathop{\rm GymCode}\nolimits}
      \left( {14} \right)$, and then use
      substitution.)</p>

      Then, since D is the 4th letter of the alphabet, shift all

      If at any point you hit Z and need to go past it, then just

      all the cards into descending order (i.e., line them up from
