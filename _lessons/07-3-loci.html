    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Picture your favorite seat on a gently turning Ferris wheel,
    the hub of the wheel of a bicycle ridden along an undulating
    country road, that chip on the rim of the wheel of the old
    trolley as it hits the smooth flat road, or the middle rung of
    a ladder as the ladder slides down a wall and along the flat
    ground.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Sketch the path of:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">The Ferris wheel seat.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">The wheel’s hub.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">The chip on the rim of the wheel of
      the old trolley.
      (Experiment with this one a bit.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">The ladder’s middle rung.
      (Experiment with this one a lot.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>To check your answer to problem 1d, try the webpage,
    http://homepage.mac.com/dscher/ladder.html</p>

    <p>These four familiar settings provide a peep into a very
    interesting concept in mathematics. In the first instance, you
    might have drawn a circle for the path of your favorite seat.
    Mathematicians would refer to this path as the locus (plural,
    loci) of the seat, and would perhaps state it more
    formally/awkwardly as follows:</p>

    <p>“The locus of the seat of the Ferris wheel is a circle whose
    center is the axis of the Ferris wheel and whose radius is
    equal to the distance from your seat to the axis.”</p>

    <p>So, in general, the locus of an object or point is the graph
    of all the possible positions the object or point could occupy
    under certain restrictions. This is the focus of our lesson. We
    will try to describe loci in words as well as in equations
    where possible, as well as to recognize shapes represented by
    particular equations.</p>

    <p>[For this lesson you will need to have a protractor, ruler
    and compass.]</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>For each of problems 2 through 7 do the following:
    
    On a sheet of graph paper set up coordinate axes.
    Find a point which satisfies the stated condition, and label it
    $P$.
    Draw as many such points $P$ as you can.
    Decide whether these points form any particular shape. If so,
    describe that shape.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The $x$-coordinate of the point is 5.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The point is always equidistant from the two points
      $A\left( {3, - 5} \right)$ and $B\left( { - 1, - 3}
      \right)$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The $x$-coordinate of the point is always less than or equal
      to the $y$-coordinate of the point.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The distance of the point from the $x$-axis is always twice
      its distance from the $y$-axis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The distance from the point to the origin is always 6.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>First graph the points $M\left( {2,3} \right)$,
      $A\left( {6,3} \right)$ and $C\left( {2,7} \right)$. Now
      the restriction on a point $P$ is that the points P, M, A and C
      must form a parallelogram. What is the locus of P?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Remember, when you describe something, be sure that your
    description is complete. It should thoroughly cover every
    aspect of what’s being described.</p>

    <p>Your description should also be unambiguous. This means that
    it should be completely clear, and not open to any different
    interpretations. You should ask yourself, “Would it be possible
    for the reader to read my description carefully, but
    misunderstand what I mean?” If so, you know you need to be more
    specific.</p>

    <p>Finally, your description should be understandable to the
    intended reader.</p>

    <p>One could describe the locus of $P$ in problem 3 as the
    perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB. Describing a
    locus in words makes it relatively easy to draw the locus, but
    it is also useful to describe the locus with an equation or
    equations, when this is possible. An equation allows you to
    find specific locus points quite quickly.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Returning to problem 3, in which $P$ is always equidistant
      from the two points $A\left( {3, - 5} \right)$ and
      $B\left( { - 1, - 3} \right)$, let the
      coordinates of $P$ be $\left( {x,y} \right)$.</p>
    </div>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/07-3-loci/diagram%208.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">The condition for $P$ could be written
    “The distance from $P$ to $A$ is the same as the distance from $P$ to
    $B$.” Using the coordinates and diagram above, translate this
    sentence into symbols.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>(continued)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">In part a, you should have written
      an equation. Simplify this equation as much as possible.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Check your answer in part b for
      plausibility in a couple of ways.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Part para-style-override-1">.
    First check to see that the point $(1, - 4)$ satisfies your
    equation in part b. Why must this be the case?</p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Part para-style-override-1">i.
    Second, choose any other point whose coordinates satisfy your
    equation and do a calculation to see if the distance from that
    point to $A$ and $B$ is the same.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Returning again to problem 3, let’s check to see if
      your
      description of the locus was indeed correct.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find the slope and midpoint of
      $\overline {AB} $.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Use your answers for part a to find
      the equation of the
      perpendicular bisector of $\overline {AB} $.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Looking again at problem 6, with the help of distance
      formula
      or Pythagoras’ Theorem, write an equation to describe the
      path of the point $P$.</p>
    </div>

    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an equation/inequality for the locus in each of the
      following.&nbsp;Also, in each case check that your answer is
      plausible by seeing if a couple of easily tested points
      indeed satisfy your equation.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Problem 2 ($P$’s $x$-coordinate is
      5.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Problem 4 (The $x$-coordinate of $P$ is

      <p class="problem-part">Write an equation for the locus of
      $P$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Check that your answer for part b
      is reasonable when h and k are negative numbers far from zero
      and $r$ is a small positive number, and then check it again for
      when $h$ and $k$ are negative numbers close to zero and $r$ is a
      large positive number.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Describe the locus of the point whose equation is:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${(x + 4)^2} + {(y + 13)^2} =
      100$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The equation of the locus of point $P$ is given. Describe or

    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>One could argue that in some cases a description of a
      locus by equation is better than a description in words. What
      do you think? Give a couple of examples to support your
      position.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In each case describe the graph and, if possible, write an

      be part of the locus.</p>

    <p>With harder problems that have formulas that you are
    deriving, a plausibility check is a necessity, as it is all too
    easy to make a conceptual or algebraic mistake when coming up
    with the equation, and a plausibility check is a quick way to
    see if you have made some kind of error. For the next few
    problems be sure to make a plausibility check so that you can
