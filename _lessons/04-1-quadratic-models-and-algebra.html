<h1>Lesson 1: Quadratic Models and Algebra</h1>
  <section class="development">


    <h2>Flu Season, Again.</h2>

    <p>One of the most unpleasant aspects of going to school is
    that when a few people get sick, they can transmit their
    illness to others very easily, and as a
    consequence most of the school can end up “catching” it.</p>

    <p>Epidemiologists, when faced with the spread of a disease,
    try to predict how quickly people will be infected by coming up
    with equations that seem to fit the data well. One reasonably
    accurate equation is called the logistic model, and is based on
    the following idea. Let I stand for the number of people
    already infected and N stand for the number who are not
    infected. Then the rate at which the disease is spreading is
    proportional to the product of I and N. For the sake of
    simplicity let’s call this product the “disease quotient” of
    DQ. Let’s assume, also, that the DQ is exactly equal to the
    product of I and N. The DQ is, therefore, a measure of how
    quickly the disease is spreading: the higher it is, the more
    people get infected that day.</p>

    <p>How would you expect DQ to change while the disease is
    spreading? At what point during the spread of the disease would
    the disease spread most quickly?</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Let’s look at a specific case — a local high school with 400
    students.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>What is the DQ when no students are infected? When 1
      student is infected? When 70 students are? When 300 are
      infected?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>Write an expression describing the DQ if one knows the
      number x of students that are infected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>Rewrite the equation in Problem 2 so that it’s in the form
      . What are a, b, and c in your equation?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Any equation that can be written in the form $y = a{x^2} +
    bx + c$ @@@@( , where $a \ne 0$ , is called a quadratic
    equation. In this lesson we will be looking at some algebraic
    tools that can be used to manipulate these equations so as to
    learn more about how the solutions of such an equation
    behave.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>Determine the number of people who are infected if $DQ =
      0$. You should get two answers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>Pick one of your answers from problem 4 and explain why,
      without talking about the disease quotient or the number
      infected or not infected, it must be a solution to the
      equation .</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>Think carefully about your answers to Problem 4 and how
      they solve the equation given in Problem 5. Now, explain why
      2 and -3/4 are solutions to the equation $\left( {4x + 3}
      \right)\left( {x - 2} \right) = 0$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="7">
      <p>Solve each of the following equations.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $x\left( {x + 10} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $\left( {x - 3} \right)\left( {x +
      2} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $\left( {x + 5} \right)\left( {x +
      7} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $- 2\left( {x - 4} \right)\left(
      {x + 9} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\left( {x + 1} \right)^2}\left(
      {3x - 1} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $\left( {4x + 5} \right)\left( {x -
      3} \right)\left( {x + 1} \right) = 0$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="8">
      <p>What must be true about A or B if $A \cdot B = 0$? Can
      the same thing be said if $A \cdot B = 8$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In Problem 8 you’re being asked to conjecture a very
    important theorem of mathematics that is often referred to as
    the Zero Product Property — anytime you have a product, then it
    can equal zero only if at least one of its factors is zero.
    This is a very powerful theorem in situations in which we can
    write an equation in the form ${\rm{BLAH}} = 0$, where BLAH
    can be written as a product. So, it seems useful here to focus
    on how to write expressions as products, don’t you think?</p>

    <p>In the Algebra Blocks lesson, you looked at how to rewrite
    an expression like ${x^2} + 7x + 10$ as a product of two
    expressions by using a diagram but also, toward the end of the
    lesson, by looking at the symbolic patterns. This process of
    rewriting the expression as a product is called factoring.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="9">
      <p>Working on your own or with your peers, factor ${x^2} + 7x
      + 10$. If you can’t remember how to do this without a
      diagram, then use a diagram, but after this, look carefully
      at your factored form of the expression and how it relates to
      the original expression.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>Solve the equation ${x^2} + 7x + 6 = 0$ r .</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="11">
      <p>Solve each of the following equations by factoring.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^2} + 3x + 2 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^2} + 6x + 9 = 0$ r</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^2} + 5x - 14 = 0$</p>
    </div>

    <p>In Problem 11 Part e, you needed to resort to negative
    numbers in order to factor the expression. Trying to diagram
    this expression as a way of factoring it would certainly be
    tricky, but using the number patterns that you’ve noticed about
    the original expression and its factored form lets you get
    around the difficulty of constructing the diagram.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="12">
      <p>Factor each of the following expressions.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^2} + 4x - 45$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^2} - 5x - 36$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^2} - x - 42$</p>
    </div>

    <p>Another hopeful outcome from the Algebra Blocks lesson was
    that you would realize that factoring is not a process reserved
    for expressions like ${x^2} + 6x + 8$, but can also be done on
    expressions like $3{x^2} + 7x$. In essence, factoring is a
    process devoted to reversing distribution: can we rewrite
    $3{x^2} + 7x$ so that its factored form, when multiplied out,
    would give us back $3{x^2} + 7x$?</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="13">
      <p>Factor $3{x^2} + 7x$. Check you work by doing the
      distribution.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="14">
      <p>Solve each of the following equations by factoring.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $2x - 5{x^2} = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $6{x^2} + 4x = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $5{x^3} - 12{x^2} = 0$</p>

      <p>Kyle is managing an upcoming concert at school and is
      concerned about the income generated by the concert just
      through ticket sales. Over the years he has come to realize
      that when the price of the ticket increases, the number of
      people willing to attend goes down. He knows that all 360
      students will attend if the concert is free, but for each $1
      increase in the price of the ticket, 20 fewer students will
      attend.</p>

    <p>The two numbers that you calculated in Problem 21 serve as
    the coordinates of a specific point on the graph of the DQ
    equation. The graph of the equation is called a parabola, and
    the point that you calculated in Problem 21 is called the
    vertex of the parabola. The vertex can be thought of as the

    <p>You may recall that the points you found in Problem 25 are
    referred to as the p-intercepts of the graph of $I = p\left(
    {360 - 20p} \right)$. They would be called the x-intercepts,
    if the horizontal axis had been labeled with x. Notice that if

      <p>You are selling candy for a price of p dollars per candy

      <p class="problem-part">. Write an equation for n (the number
      of people who want candy) in terms of p.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. The government charges a candy tax
      of \$1.50 per candy bar. So when someone buys a candy bar,
      \$1.50 of what they pay goes to the tax. Write an equation for
      how much you earn for selling one candy bar, if you charge a
      price of p.</p>
