    <h2>Flu Season, Again.</h2>

    <p>One of the most unpleasant aspects of going to school is
    that when a few people get sick, they can transmit their
    illness to others very easily, and as a
    consequence most of the school can end up “catching” it.</p>

    <p>Epidemiologists, when faced with the spread of a disease,
    try to predict how quickly people will be infected by coming up
    with equations that seem to fit the data well. One reasonably
    accurate equation is called the logistic model, and is based on
    the following idea. Let $I$ stand for the number of people
    already infected and $N$ stand for the number who are not
    infected. Then the rate at which the disease is spreading is
    proportional to the product of $I$ and $N$. For the sake of
    simplicity let’s call this product the “disease quotient” of
    $DQ$. Let’s assume, also, that the $DQ$ is exactly equal to the
    product of $I$ and $N$. The $DQ$ is, therefore, a measure of how
    quickly the disease is spreading: the higher it is, the more
    people get infected that day.</p>

    <p>How would you expect $DQ$ to change while the disease is
    spreading? At what point during the spread of the disease would
    the disease spread most quickly?</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Let’s look at a specific case — a local high school with 400
    students.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the $DQ$ when no students are infected? When 1
      student is infected? When 70 students are? When 300 are
      infected?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an expression describing the $DQ$ if one knows the
      number $x$ of students that are infected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Rewrite the equation in Problem 2 so that it’s in the form
      $DQ = ax^2 + bx + c$. What are $a$, $b$, and $c$ in your equation?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Any equation that can be written in the form $y = a{x^2} +
    bx + c$, where $a \ne 0$, is called a quadratic
    equation. In this lesson we will be looking at some algebraic
    tools that can be used to manipulate these equations so as to
    learn more about how the solutions of such an equation
    behave.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Determine the number of people who are infected if $DQ =
      0$. You should get two answers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Pick one of your answers from problem 4 and explain why,
      without talking about the disease quotient or the number
      infected or not infected, it must be a solution to the
      equation $x(400-x) = 0$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Think carefully about your answers to Problem 4 and how
      they solve the equation given in Problem 5. Now, explain why
      2 and -3/4 are solutions to the equation $\left( {4x + 3}
      \right)\left( {x - 2} \right) = 0$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve each of the following equations.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x\left( {x + 10} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\left( {x - 3} \right)\left( {x +
      2} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\left( {x + 5} \right)\left( {x +
      7} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$- 2\left( {x - 4} \right)\left(
      {x + 9} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\left( {x + 1} \right)^2}\left(
      {3x - 1} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\left( {4x + 5} \right)\left( {x -
      3} \right)\left( {x + 1} \right) = 0$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What must be true about $A$ or $B$ if $A \cdot B = 0$? Can
      the same thing be said if $A \cdot B = 8$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In Problem 8 you’re being asked to conjecture a very important theorem
    of mathematics that is often referred to as the <em class="vocab">Zero
      Product Property</em> — anytime you have a product, then it can equal
    zero only if at least one of its factors is zero.  This is a very powerful
    theorem in situations in which we can write an equation in the form
    ${\rm{BLAH}} = 0$, where BLAH can be written as a product. So, it seems
    useful here to focus on how to write expressions as products, don’t you
    think?</p>

    <p>There is a way to rewrite expressions ${x^2} + 7x + 10$ as a product of two expressions, so that it looks like $(x+\ldots)(x+ \ldots )$.  You may have seen this technique before: it is called  
    <em class="vocab">factoring</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Working on your own or with your peers, factor ${x^2} + 7x
      + 10$. When you have an answer, look carefully
      at your factored form of the expression and how it relates to
      the original expression.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve the equation ${x^2} + 7x + 6 = 0$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve each of the following equations by factoring.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 3x + 2 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x^2 + 8x + 12 =0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x^2 + 20x + 64 =0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 6x + 9 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 5x - 14 = 0$</p>
    </div>

    <p>In Problem 11 Part e, you needed to resort to negative
    numbers in order to factor the expression. Trying to diagram
    this expression as a way of factoring it would certainly be
    tricky, but using the number patterns that you’ve noticed about
    the original expression and its factored form lets you get
    around the difficulty of constructing the diagram.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Factor each of the following expressions.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 4x - 45$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} - 5x - 36$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} - x - 42$</p>
    </div>

    <p>Another hopeful outcome from the Algebra Blocks lesson was
    that you would realize that factoring is not a process reserved
    for expressions like ${x^2} + 6x + 8$, but can also be done on
    expressions like $3{x^2} + 7x$. In essence, factoring is a
    process devoted to reversing distribution: can we rewrite
    $3{x^2} + 7x$ so that its factored form, when multiplied out,
    would give us back $3{x^2} + 7x$?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Factor $3{x^2} + 7x$. Check your work by doing the
      distribution.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve each of the following equations by factoring.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$2x - 5{x^2} = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$6{x^2} + 4x = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$5{x^3} - 12{x^2} = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^3} - 8{x^2} + 16x = 0$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Kyle is managing an upcoming concert at school and is
      concerned about the income generated by the concert just
      through ticket sales. Over the years he has come to realize
      that when the price of the ticket increases, the number of
      people willing to attend goes down. He knows that all 360
      students will attend if the concert is free, but for each $1
      increase in the price of the ticket, 20 fewer students will
      attend.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many students will attend if
      Kyle charges \$2 per ticket? How many if he charges \$5?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What income will Kyle generate if
      he charges \$2 per ticket? What if he charges \$8?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an expression for the income
      $I$ generated by the concert when the price of the ticket is $p$.
      Is this a quadratic equation?</p>

      to zero and solve this equation. Explain the meaning of the

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 3x - 28$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} - 7x - 18$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">

      <p class="problem-part">$5x^4 + x^3 =0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x^3 + 5x^2 - 14x =0$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph the equation you came up with in Problem 2 on a
      calculator. (If you have trouble seeing the graph, take a
      look at the values you computed in Problem 1.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use the graph in Problem 18 to determine when the $DQ$ is
      25600. Explain why both of your answers make sense in terms
      of the spread of a disease.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many people have been infected if $DQ = 20000$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Determine the maximum $DQ$. How many people are infected at
      this point?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Explain how you can use your answers to Problem 19 to
      solve Problem 21. Could you have used the answers from
      Problem 20 to solve problem 21?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The two numbers that you calculated in Problem 21 serve as the
    coordinates of a specific point on the graph of the $DQ$ equation. The
    graph of the equation is called a <em class="vocab">parabola</em>, and the
    point that you calculated in Problem 21 is called the <em
      class="vocab">vertex</em> of the parabola. The vertex can be thought of
    as the point where the parabola
    turns.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The graph of $DQ = x(400-x)$ is symmetric over a vertical line. Write an
      equation for this line.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>An answer to Problem 15 Part c could be $I = p\left( {360 - 20p}
      \right)$. Graph this equation on your calculator, then write an equation
      for its <em class="vocab">line (or axis) of symmetry.</em> You might look
      at Problem 15 Part d to help you solve this problem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The graph of $I = p\left( {360 - 20p} \right)$ intersects
      the $p$-axis. What are the coordinates of the
      intersection(s)?</p>
    </div>

    <p>You may recall that the points you found in Problem 25 are
    referred to as the $p$-intercepts of the graph of $I = p\left(
    {360 - 20p} \right)$. They would be called the $x$-intercepts,
    if the horizontal axis had been labeled with $x$. Notice that if
    you determine the intercepts on the horizontal axis of a
    parabola then you can determine the axis of symmetry and the
    vertex of the parabola.</p>

      bar. 100 people want candy if it’s free, but every time the
      price goes up by a dollar, 3 fewer people want candy.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an equation for $n$ (the number
      of people who want candy) in terms of $p$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">The government charges a candy tax
      of $\$1.50$ per candy bar. So when someone buys a candy bar,
      $\$1.50$ of what they pay goes to the tax. Write an equation for
      how much you earn for selling one candy bar, if you charge a
      price of $p$.</p>
