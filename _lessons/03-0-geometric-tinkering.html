    <p>When you have a diagram, it is sometimes helpful to <em class="vocab">Fill
    in all the Information you Can</em>, even if you think it has
    nothing to do with the problem you have to solve. This is
    another example of <em class="vocab">tinkering</em>. Doing this will help you to see
    patterns and to notice things about the diagram that you
    might not have noticed otherwise. It is a wonderful thing to
    do when you are stuck on a problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>The radius of the smallest circle is one unit. What is
        the ratio of
        the area of the largest circle to the area of the smallest
        circle?</p>

    <p class='new-page'>In the problem on the previous page, rather than trying to figure out the
    ratio of the two areas immediately, it makes more sense to
    figure out some smaller, manageable thing about the figure,
    and see where that leads us. A clear place to start is with
    the smallest circle. Once we find the area of that circle, we
    can then find the square that surrounds it. Can we then find
    the area of the second largest circle? By looking at the
    smallest parts, we can see the pattern which allows us to
    solve the original problem.</p>

    <p>In your previous experience with geometry, you probably
    learned some basic facts about angles, lines, and triangles.
    For instance, two angles that form a line add up to 180
    degrees, and so do the three angles of a triangle. You may
    also know that, in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite
    the sides that are the same length are also the same. These
    facts will help you with many of the problems that
    follow.</p>
