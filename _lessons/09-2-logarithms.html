<h1>Lesson 2: Introduction</h1><h1>to Logarithms</h1>
  <section class="development">




    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The following tree diagrams, which are called binary trees,
    are all based on the same system for organizing
    information.</p>

    <p>Each item (phone number, animal, letter) in the tree is
    called a “node”, and the nodes immediately below a node are
    called its “children”. As you can see, each node in the tree
    has at most two children. Furthermore, notice that as you start
    at the top and travel down the branches, every descendant down
    the right branch of a given node is somehow more than (or
    larger than, or after) that node, whereas every descendent to
    the left is somehow less.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>Let’s say we wanted to add the number “866-3162” to the
      phone number tree above. Even though it comes after
      “393-1765”, it would be wrong to hang it to the right of that
      number, because that would still be down the left branch from
      “555-1791”. Where should “866-3162” go? How about “squirrel”
      and “k” in their respective trees? There is only one correct
      answer for each of these.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>Ask a group member to write down, without showing you, a
      list of 10 different numbers. Your group member will be
      reading the list to you one number at a time, and your job is
      to organize them into a binary search tree as they’re being
      read to you. There’s one rule: unlike in nature, these trees
      grow down. This means, for example, that the first number
      your group member reads will have to be the one at the very
      top of your tree.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Have your group member read the
      numbers to you, giving you time to add each number to the
      tree, without rearranging the ones you’ve added so far,
      before reading the next one out.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What would have happened if the
      numbers had been read to you in a different order? Try it and
      see.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In these small examples, it’s quite easy to see all the
    information at once, so they’re not necessarily any better than
    just writing out a simple list. Imagine, though, that instead
    of the 7 phone numbers in the first diagram, you had a binary
    tree with hundreds of phone numbers in it. (By the way, this is
    essentially how a cell phone really does store phone
    numbers.)</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>Alice the ant starts at the top node of this large phone
      number tree and wants to know if the exterminator’s number,
      which she knows by heart, is in it. (She’s hoping it’s not!)
      Because Alice is so small, she can only read one node at a
      time, and she has to crawl down a branch to read another
      number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Describe a simple algorithm she can
      use to find out where the exterminator’s number would have to
      be, if it were in the tree.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Which of the following trees do you
      think Alice would rather search? Remember the old saying:
      when you’re trying to find something, it’s always in the last
      place you look!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>You saw from problem 2 that there is more than one possible
    “shape” that a binary tree can take, even with the same raw
    data.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>For each of the following, come up with a sequence of
      items, which, if you used your approach from problem 2, would
      end up in a binary tree with the given shape. (The items can
      be anything you want: names, numbers, etc.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$a$. <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image5.tif.jpg" > b.
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image6.tif.jpg" ></p>

      <p class="problem-part">$c$. <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image7.tif.jpg" ></p>
    </div>

    <p>The depth of a node in a tree is the number of branches it
    is away from the top. So, for example, “chicken” in the animal
    tree has a depth of 2. The depth of the whole tree is just the
    depth of its deepest node. (So the animal tree has a depth of
    3, because “mouse”, the deepest node, has a depth of 3.)</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>Rearrange the lists of items you used in problem 4 so that
      the resulting trees have the minimum possible depth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>Do the same for the list your group used in problem 2.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The trees you made in problem 5 are examples of balanced
    binary trees, whereas the one you made in problem 6 is not
    balanced. To see why, think of the tree like a hanging mobile:
    if each node is perfectly balanced, then the whole thing is
    balanced.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="7">
      <p>Is it possible to arrange the numbers 1 through 7 into a
      balanced binary tree? How about 1 through 12? 1 through
      15?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="8">
      <p>A leaf of a tree is a node that doesn’t have any children.
      Notice that in a balanced binary tree, all the leaves have
      the same depth. If a balanced binary tree has 512 leaves,
      then what is the depth of the tree?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="9">
      <p>Of course, not all trees have to be binary. If you
      continued
      the regular pattern of the tree below, how many leaves would
      the next level of the tree have? How deep would it need to be
      in order to have 4096 leaves?</p>

<p>      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>On some ancient computers, passwords had to consist of
      only the letters A through E. If I tell you that on these
      computers, there were 15625 passwords, and all of the
      passwords had to be the same length, can you say how many
      letters were required in a password?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the last three problems, you were effectively looking for
    exponents. You might have found yourself asking, in rather
    awkward English, the question:</p>

    <p>“5 to the what power equals 15625?”</p>

    <p>Fortunately, there’s a mathematical term for the number
    we’re looking for here: it’s called “the logarithm, base 5, of
    15625”. Symbolically, it’s written “${\log _5}\left( {15625}
    \right)$”.</p>

    <p>So our awkward question is now both easier to pronounce,</p>

    <p>“What is the log, base 5, of 15625?”</p>

    <p>and easier to write,</p>

    <p>“”.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="11">
      <p>Translate the equation above into an equation involving
      exponents.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="12">
      <p>Go back and set up problems 8-10 with equations using log
      notation. (No need to solve them again—just set them up.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="13">
      <p>Use symbols to create a formal definition for what it
      means to say that “y is the log, base b, of x”. Your
      definition should have the form:
      “(equation involving log) if and only if (equation
      involving
      exponents)”.</p>

<p>      This is something you can refer to whenever you need to
      translate to and from “log” notation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="14">
      <p>Consider the following binary tree.</p>
    </div>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/11.1.2%20-%20letter%20tree.ai" >
    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">. Assuming this tree was built
    similarly to the one you built in problem 2, what order could
    the letters have been added in?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">. What ordering would you use to
    produce a tree with the greatest possible depth?</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="15">
      <p>Determine the depth of each of the trees described
      below.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. A balanced binary tree that has
      1,048,576 leaves.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Every node that isn’t a leaf has 4
      children. There are 64 leaves.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Every non-leaf node has 6 children,
      and there are X leaves. (Answer in terms of X, using log
      notation.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="16">
      <p>Unlike on this planet, primordial amoebas from Mars
      reproduce by splitting into three children. If life on Mars
      started with a single amoeba, but now there are 1,594,323
      amoebas, then:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Estimate, without using a
      calculator, for how many
      amoeba-generations there has been life on Mars.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Now rewrite the question as a
      logarithm, and find
      an exact answer (calculator allowed this time).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="17">
      <p>Translate the following awkward bits of English into log
      notation. (Notice that some are complete sentences, and
      others are fragments.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. “What number could I raise 4 to, to
      get 64?”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. “The power of 3 that gives you
      81”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. “4 to the something-or-other power
      equals 1024.”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. “The number to which 6 must be
      raised in order to produce 216”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. “The number of times, starting with
      1, that you have to double to get x”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="18">
      <p>Calculate the value of each of the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _3}\left( {81} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _{13}}\left( {169}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _8}\left( {512} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _{11}}\left( {14,641}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _{100}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _{1,000}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _{10}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _{15}}\left( {11,390,625}
      \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="19">
      <p>Start with $x = 243$. Check with your calculator that
      ${\log _3}\left( x \right) = 5$. How much do you have to add
      to x to make ${\log _3}\left( x \right)$ go up by one? Up by
      two? Three?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="20">
      <p>What is the value of ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since the number 3 is not one of the powers of 9, it’s not
    clear just what this question means, or how to find out what
    the value of ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right)$ would be.
    Remember, though, that it’s also possible to have non-integer
    exponents. Let’s see if we can use that to find an answer.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="21">
      <p>Start by rewriting ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right) = x$ in
      exponential form. Then, try tinkering with different ways to
      write this equation by applying some of your rules of
      exponents.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You might have noticed in the problem above that it was much
    simpler to solve once you’d rewritten “3” as
    “${9^{{\raise0.5ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle 1$}
    \kern-0.1em/\kern-0.15em \lower0.25ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle
    2$}}}}$”. In the next problem, try using a similar strategy:
    tinker with different ways of rewriting things, using the
    definition of logarithms and your exponent rules. (You might
    want to take a minute with your group to remind yourselves of
    all the rules.)</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="22">
      <p>Find the value of each of the following without using a
      calculator.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _4}\left( {32} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _5}\left( {\frac{1}{{25}}}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _{10}}\left( {0.000000001}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\log _7}\left( 1 \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="23">
      <p>Why can you be sure that ${\log _2}\left( {42} \right)$ is
      not an integer?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="24">
      <p>Find every number from 1 to 1 million whose base-10
      logarithm is an integer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="25">
      <p>The “log” button on your calculator actually stands for
      “${\log _{10}}$淥| ”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Before trying it out, can you
      estimate roughly what ${\log _{10}}\left( {4000} \right)$ will be? Check it on the calculator.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What are ${\log _{10}}\left( {40}
      \right)$, ${\log _{10}}\left( {40,000} \right)$, and${\log
      _{10}}\left( 4 \right)$? What’s the pattern?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="26">
      <p>Pick several three-digit numbers, and use your calculator
      to find the base-10 log of each one. Now do the same with
      several four-, five-, and six-digit numbers. What do you
      notice?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="27">
      <p>If ${\log _{10}}\left( 2 \right) = 0.301$, then what is
      the value of ${\log _{10}}\left( {2 \cdot {{10}^a}} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you want to see why your answer to the previous problem
    is true, try using
    the definition of log and your exponent rules to tinker with
    different ways of rewriting things, like you did earlier in
    problems 20-22. This will also help with the next two
    problems.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="28">
      <p>If ${\log _2}\left( x \right) = 1.125$ and ${\log
      _2}\left( y \right) = 2.875$, then what is the value of
      ${\log _2}\left( {x \cdot y} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="29">
      <p>If ${\log _4}\left( x \right) = 1.20$ and ${\log _4}\left(
