    <div class="problem">
      <p>You might recall from Physics class that Newton’s 2nd Law
      of Motion tells us that the net force on an object divided by
      its mass equals its acceleration, i.e., $a = \frac{F_{net}}{m}$. Let’s look at the
      case of a person pushing a bobsled and its passengers on the
      ice.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">If the mass of the bobsled and
    passengers is 300 kg and the person pushes so that there is a
    net force of 900 Newtons on the bobsled, what is the
    acceleration of the bobsled (the units are in
    meters/sec$^{2}$)?</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> If the net force on the
    bobsled is tripled, does the acceleration triple?</p>

 	<p class="problem-part"> If, instead, the net force
    remained at 900 N but the mass of the bobsled and passengers
    was tripled from part a, what would happen to the
    acceleration?</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> What would be the effect on
    the acceleration of tripling the net force and the mass from
    part a at the same time?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What would happen to the
    acceleration if the net force were the same as part a, but the
    mass of the bobsled and passengers was cut in half?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Finally, what would be the
    effect on the acceleration if one both doubled the net force
    from part a and halved the mass at the same time?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>As you know, the circumference of a circle and the area of
      a circle of radius $r$ can be found through the formulas $C =
      2\pi r$ and $A = \pi {r^2}$.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">If one circle has a radius of
    1 meter and another has a radius of 3 meters, how many times
    bigger is the circumference of the second circle? How many
    times bigger is its area?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">If one circle has a radius of
    2.687 meters and another has a radius 3 times as big, how many
    times bigger is the circumference of the second circle? How
    many times bigger is its area?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Based on parts a and b, what
    do you think you can conclude in general? Prove your answer by
    considering two circles, one with radius $X$ and the other with
    radius $3X$, and by doing some minor algebra.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">The volume of a sphere of
    radius $r$ can be found by using the formula $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}$. If you have two
    spheres, where the larger sphere has a radius 5 times that of
    the smaller sphere, how many times bigger must the larger
    sphere’s volume be? Prove that your answer is correct no matter
    what the radius of the smaller sphere is.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">If one sphere is
    $\frac{1}{4}$ the radius of another, what fraction of the
    larger sphere is the volume of the smaller sphere? Again, prove
    your answer works for any two spheres that have this
    relationship.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The braking distance of a car is the minimum distance a
      car going at speed $v$ can stop in (by using the brakes,
      of course). By using some fundamental physics, one can
      calculate the braking distance, assuming a car of average
      weight and a dry road, by the equation $d = .06{v^2}$,
      where $v$ is in miles per hour and $d$ is in feet.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">If Jessup hits the brakes
    while driving in his jalopy at 20 mph, what is his braking
    distance? Alternatively, if Tess takes 384 ft. to stop, how
    fast was she going in her Miata?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Julie says that if she goes 40
    mph she will stop in twice the distance than if she was going
    20 mph. Is Julie correct? If so, show why. If not, how many
    times bigger is the 40 mph braking distance than the 20 mph
    braking distance?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">
      Determine how fast Julie would <em>actually</em> have to go to stop
    in twice the distance.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">
    How many times faster than 20 mph would she have to go to
    stop in 16 times as much distance as she would have stopped in
    at 20 mph?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">
    How many times faster than 20 mph would she have to go to
    stop in $M$ times as much distance as she would have stopped in
    at 20 mph?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Given a cube of side length $x$,</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">What is its volume?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What is its surface area?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">
    If the length of the cube were to change to $5x$, then by what
    multiple would its volume increase?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">If the length of the cube were
    to change to $5x$, by what multiple would its surface area
    increase? Why doesn’t the “$6$” in the surface area formula
    affect your answer?</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the previous problem you examined the volume and
      surface area of a cube; you found that they were related to
      the side length $x$ by a cubic $({x^3})$ and a quadratic
      ($6{x^2}$). Is this true of more complicated shapes? Let’s
      see.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">Say that there is an
    irregularly shaped drawing that looks like, say, Big Bird.

<figure>
  <img src="../images/10-3-variation-and-proportion/Lesson 3 - graph 5.tif.jpg">
</figure>
























    Obtain a copy of this drawing from your teacher. How could you
    approximate its area in square centimeters to a reasonable
    degree of accuracy with a ruler?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Now if you doubled all the
    dimensions of this drawing (i.e. its height, its width, the
    distance between Big Bird’s eyes — everything), how would its
    area change? Why? What if you scaled it up by a factor of 5
    instead?</p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>At the Macy’s Day parade last year, there was an enormous
      balloon of Spongebob Squarepants that was 40 ft high. Toy
      copies of this balloon were being sold on the parade route
      and were 3 inches high.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">Assuming the other dimensions
    were proportionally reduced, what is the scale factor of the
    copy in comparison to the original balloon?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Approximately how many of the
    toy copies would it take to fill the 40 ft. balloon?</p>
      
    </div>

    <p>The types of relationships between variables that you have
    been exploring in the previous problems are special cases of
    two broad categories: direct proportionality and inverse
    proportionality.</p>

    <p>$y$ is <em class="vocab">directly proportional</em> to $x$ when $y = kx$, where $x$
    and $y$ are variables and $k$ is a constant not equal to 0. Another
      way of saying this is that $y$ <em class="vocab">varies directly</em> with $x$. For
    example, in problem 2, where $C = 2\pi r$, we say that $C$ is
    directly proportional to $r$, or that $C$ varies directly with
    $r$.</p>

    <p>$y$ is <em class="vocab">inversely proportional</em> to $x$ when $y = \frac{k}{x}$,
    where $x$ and $y$ are variables and $k$ is a constant not equal to 0.
      Another way of saying this is that $y$ <em class="vocab">varies inversely</em> (or
      <em class="vocab">indirectly</em>) with $x$. For example, in problem 1c, where $a =
    \frac{{900}}{m}$, we say that $a$ is inversely proportional to
    $m$, or that $a$ varies inversely with $m$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Answer the following questions by using the definitions of
      direct and inverse proportionality given above.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">If $WZ = 100$, are $W$ and $Z$
    directly or inversely proportional, or neither?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">If $\frac{C}{T} = 64$, do $C$
    and $T$ vary directly or indirectly, or neither?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">If $P = Q + 20$, are $P$ and
    $Q$ directly or inversely proportional, or neither?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Suppose $Z$ is directly
    proportional to $S$. As $S$ increases, must $Z$ also increase?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Suppose $M$ varies inversely
    with $R$. As $R$ increases, must $M$ decrease?</p>
      
    </div>

    <p class="No-Paragraph-Style">Just as it is useful to say that
    “$A$ varies directly with $B$”, we can apply this language to a
    wider range of expressions as well. For example, in problem 4,
    where $A = 6{x^2}$, we can say that $A$ varies directly with
    ${x^2}$, as $A$ is equal to a constant times ${x^2}$.
    Alternatively, we could also have said in words that surface
    area is directly proportional to the square of the side length
    of the cube.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the following questions, either write an equation
      (which may have an unknown constant $k$ in it) based on the
      sentence given, or write a sentence based on the equation
      given.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">The weight of a human is
    directly proportional to its volume.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">The surface area of a sphere
    varies directly with the square of its radius.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">From problem 3, $d =
    .06{v^2}$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">The intensity of light varies
    inversely with the square of the distance from the light
    source.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">$G = \frac{5}{{7{w^3}}}$,
    where G are “galumphs” and w are “wagdoodles”.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">The height of an
    extra-terrestrial varies directly with the square root of the
    length of its yellow antennae.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The width of a rectangle is 12 ft and the length is 24
        ft. By what <em>multiple</em> does the area change if:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the study of waves one discovers the relationship
      between the velocity, wavelength, and frequency of any wave:
      $v = \lambda f$. For example, if the wavelength is 4
      meters and the frequency is 6 cycles/second, then the
      velocity would be 24 meters/second.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Say that you were looking at a
      different wave that had twice the wavelength and half the
      frequency. How many times bigger or smaller would the
      velocity be than in the example?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Say instead that you were looking
      at a different wave that had 2.5 times the wavelength and 4
      times the frequency. How many times bigger or smaller would
      the velocity be than in the example?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The heat emitted per second (Q) due to radiation from an
      object is directly proportional to the fourth power of
      temperature T (in $^\circ K$) of the object. If the
      temperature of a quantity of metal triples, how much greater
      will its heat output be per second as a consequence?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Biologists have determined a good approximation of the
      relationship between the mass of a flying object and its
      optimum cruising velocity. “Optimum cruising velocity” is
      defined as the velocity at which an object travels the most
      distance for a given amount of energy it expends; the easiest
      analogy is with cars, where the most fuel efficient speed to
        drive turns out to be 55 mph.</p>

      <p>The relationship is $M = \frac{{{V^6}}}{{729000000}}$,
      where $V$ is the optimum cruising speed measured in
      meters/second and $M$ is the mass of the object measured in
      kilograms. This relationship holds for birds, insects, and
      even planes!

      <p>The gravitational attraction of two objects
      is described by the equation $F = \frac{k}{{{d^2}}}$
      (where $d$ is the distance in meters between the centers of the
      objects, $k$ is a constant based on the masses of the objects,
      and $F$ is the force of attraction between them, measured in
      Newtons). For brevity, one often says that Gravity is an
      “inverse square” force, which just means that the force is
      inversely proportional to the distance squared.</p>

      <p>“The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman!” was a campy “sci-fi”
      thriller from the 1950’s, about a woman who, due to an alien
      encounter, grows to be a 50 ft giant, wreaking havoc on the
      metropolis she lives in. Could humans prosper at such heights
      if, say, our DNA gave our body permission to “keep growing”?
      Let’s check it out.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Here are two important facts: 1)
      The weight of any animal is directly proportional to its
      volume, and 2) The strength of a bone is directly
      proportional to the cross-sectional area of the bone. Write
      equations that represent these relationships.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A 50 ft woman is 10 times taller
      than a <br>5 ft woman, indicating that one could roughly think
      of her as a 5 ft woman scaled up by a factor of 10 in all
      dimensions. How many times more would the 50 ft woman weigh
      than the 5 ft woman?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Since all dimensions are scaled by
      a factor of 10, how many times stronger would the 50ft.
      woman’s bones be than the 5 ft woman’s?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Bones in the leg break if they are
      under too much strain/pressure, that is, if there is too much
      weight above pressing down on the bones. Using your answers
      to parts b and c, determine how the pressure (i.e.
      $\frac{{{\rm{Weight}}}}{{{\rm{Cross - sectional \ area}}}}$
      of the leg bones) on the 50ft woman’s leg bones compares to
      the 5 ft woman’s.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Thus explain why animals that are
      small would have difficulty if they grew too large, even
      given that their DNA permitted it. That is, why aren’t there
