        <p>Why are manhole covers circular, instead of square?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>You may have heard this “old chestnut” before. (If you have,
      don’t spoil it for everyone else!) If you haven’t, you
      may not have any idea how to even begin to think about
      the problem. Since this is a question about shapes, it
      may help to draw a picture. Better yet, you could build
      a model of the situation using, say, a cylindrical oatmeal
      box and a more rectangular box of cocoa powder. Now that
      you have a model, play around with it. Look at it from
      all different angles. Try placing the covers on the different
      “manholes.” Do you notice anything?</p>

    <p>There are many ways to <em class="vocab">visualize</em> in
      solving a problem. Sometimes visualizing can be as simple
      as plotting several points on a graph and interpreting
      what you see. Visualizing can also involve <em>altering</em>
      or <em>adding to</em> a given picture to make the problem
      easier.</p>

    <p>You may have divided the figure in the previous problem into
      triangles, or even “boxed it in” and found the area of
      the rectangles you’d created. Either way, the way you reconceived
      the diagram made it much easier to solve.</p>

  <section class="problems">
    <p>In the problems that follow, one of two strategies will help
      you: 1) Draw or build a model of the situation to make
      it easier to understand. 2) Alter an existing diagram in
      some way to gain more information, or simply to help you
      look at the diagram in a different way.</p>

      <p>Below is the usual arrangement of 10 bowling pins, with
        the “single pin” at the bottom. By moving only 3 of the
        pins, can you “flip” the arrangement 180 degrees so that
        the single pin is now at the top?</p>

      <p>Alice and Bruno work in a city where the streets are laid
        out in a grid pattern. City Hall is at (0,0). Alice and
        Bruno work at (–3,–1) and (3,3) respectively. They wish
        to find an apartment at a point C such that the sum of
        the distances each of them has to walk to work is a minimum.
        Of course, Alice and Bruno can’t walk “as the crow flies”
        — there are buildings in the way. So what they really
        mean when they talk about distance is the number of blocks
        they’d have to walk if they always stay on the sidewalk.

      <p>Let’s look at the exciting, dramatic adventures of a bobsledder.</p>

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="a">. A bobsledder starts a race by going 100 miles South.
        He then goes 100 miles East, and then 100 miles North
        to complete the race. Amazingly, the end of the race
        is at the exact same place as the start of the race!
        How is this possible?</p>

      <p>You have an 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper (standard size).
        Fold the paper in half so the top edge and the bottom

        diagonal of the entire sheet of paper, and keep one of
        the triangular pieces.</p>

      <p> What’s the area of the piece of the triangle that’s above

      <p class="problem-part" data-part="a">. Find a way to measure the longest diagonal of the brick—the
        one that goes “inside” the brick to connect opposite
        corners. (Since you have no calculator, you won’t be
        able to use the Pythagorean Theorem.)</p>

        to cut a cylindrical piece of cheese into 8 identical
        pieces, and unsurprisingly, it takes him 4 cuts.</p>

      <p> Rosie, his nemesis, claims she could have done it in only

        longer than four feet on this bus! Without the bus, Shelly
        is stranded, so she goes back to the store to return

      <p> You measure the cylinder and find that it is 10 inches
