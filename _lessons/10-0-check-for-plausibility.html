    <p>If you were told by a classmate that taking a cup of
    brackish lukewarm water three times a day for a month would
    heal your broken leg, you would probably laugh out loud. And
    even though your laughter might be a bit more subdued were the
    source of that statement the health segment of the evening
    news, I bet that you would nonetheless be quite skeptical. On
    many levels this would seem to you to be highly implausible,
    and so you might either absolutely dismiss it or yield to that
    nagging curiosity and check out some other sources.</p>

    <p>On the other hand there are a host of other more reasonable
    sounding claims that you might be prepared to let slide.
    Examples might include the claim that an increase in oil prices
    pushes a decline in the Dow Industrial averages, or that there
    is a strong correlation between wealth and SAT scores. It
    doesn’t seem unreasonable to hold a healthy skepticism for
    these as well.</p>

    <p>In the context of mathematics, to <em class="vocab">check for plausibility</em> is
    to routinely check the reasonableness of any statement in a
    problem or its proposed solution, regardless of whether it
    seems true or false on initial impression; to be particularly
    skeptical of results that seem contradictory or implausible,
    whether the source be peer, teacher, evening news, book,
    newspaper, internet or some other; and to look at special and
    limiting cases to see if a formula or an argument makes sense
    in some easily examined specific situations.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-content">
  
      <p>Your classmate proposed traveling 240 miles to the beach
      at an average speed of 80 mph, and the next day traveling
      home at 40 mph. He pointed out that since you have an average
      speed of 60 mph, the total 480 miles there and back takes 8
      hours. Yet when you went to the beach, it didn’t take 8 hours
      round trip, even though you two drove at precisely the speeds
      he had proposed. Why?</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>It certainly seems at first glance that your classmate is
    correct, but just because a result seems superficially correct
    doesn’t make it so. When there is an apparent contradiction in
    a problem, it often pays to make a quick check or two to see if
    what is being said is plausible. For example, how long does
    each half of the beach trip take?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
      <p>Martin says, looking at the figure below, that the entire
      rectangle’s area divided by the area of the square inside is
      equal to $\dfrac {a} {b} + 1$. Melissa thinks that such a peculiarly
      simple answer is unlikely to be correct. Martin insists he’s
      right, and that in fact his formula would work for any values
      of $a$ and $b$ one might choose. How could Melissa check to see
      if Martin’s formula is at least plausibly correct?</p>

    <p>One particular way that we check the reasonableness of a
    solution to a problem is to examine special and limiting cases.
    In the problem above, what would those cases be? Well, one
    special case would surely be when $a=b$, because you could quickly determine the right answer and check if Martin’s formula is correct there. What about if we examined
    when “$a$” was small and “$b$” was large—say $a=1$ and $b=100$, or even $a=1$ and $b=10000$? Does Martin’s formula make sense in those
    cases as well? Can you come up with another limiting case, and
    see if his formula is plausible for that case as well?</p>

    <p>Once you have checked a solution for all the limiting cases
    you can think of, if it still seems like a reasonable solution,
    you might think about how to prove it always works yourself
    from first principles. Can you come up with Martin’s
    formula?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If one looks at $y=x^2$ on the calculator in “ZOOM SQR” mode (so that the scale in
      the $x$ and $y$ directions are the same and the graph looks most
      accurate), it appears that the graph is getting so steep, so
      quickly, that it will eventually become a vertical line.
      
      Does it? If so, estimate for what x value it becomes
      vertical; if not, explain why that can never happen.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>While teaching in Brazil, Tony was approached by a fellow
      math teacher who said the following: “Hey Tony, do you know
      how to prove that all right triangles are similar? I was
      trying to show my students in class today and I couldn’t
      quite do it.” Could you have helped him out?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>On a 3-D blueprint for an Olympic swimming pool, 1 ft.
      represents 16 actual feet. In order to determine how much
      water would be needed to fill the pool, Tim computes the
      volume from the blueprint, which is $4 \text{ ft}^3$, and then he
      multiplies by the scale factor of 16 to get $64 \text{ ft}^3$ of water to
      fill the pool. Tim is a little unsure if that is the correct
      amount, but it seems right. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If Jorge told you that 3.16227765 was an exact solution to $x^2=10$, how could you determine without a
      calculator if he is correct, or slightly off?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Hero of Alexandria came up with a formula to determine the
      area of any triangle based solely on the lengths of its 3
      sides. Below are 4 formulas, all of which purport to be
      Hero’s formula. In all 4 formulas, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the
      lengths of the sides, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter, which is
      equal to half the perimeter.</p>
    
      <p align="center">$Area = \left(s-a \right)\left(s-b\right)\left(s-c\right)$</p>
      <p align="center">$Area = \sqrt {\dfrac {(s)(a)(b)(c)} {10}}$</p>
      <p align="center">$Area = \sqrt {(s)(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$</p>
      <p align="center">$Area = \sqrt {3(a+b+c)}$</p>

    
    <p class="problem-part">Which of these formulas do you think
    is the right one? Why?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Try seeing if the formulas give the
    kind of answers you would expect for various “common” triangles
    you have experience with.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Test to see if “extreme” triangles
    (ones with very large or small values of some of the sides)
    also give reasonable results.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What units do you typically measure
    area in? Does that also help you in deciding which formulas are
    most plausible?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Now pick the formula you are most
    confident is the right one. Does the fact that it has passed
    all your “tests” prove that it is correct? If so, explain why.
    If not, explain how you could become convinced that Hero was in
    fact correct.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Look at these 6 numbers: 1, 3, 6, 9, 11 and 12. Their mean
      is 7. Subtracting the mean from each of the numbers and
      adding those together gives us $-6+-4+-1+2+4+5$, which equals 0. Juniper is unimpressed, and
      says that you would always get 0, regardless of the 6 numbers
      you chose. Sassafras disagrees, and says it is highly
      dependent on choosing the right 6 numbers; for example, in
      this case, exactly 3 were above the mean and exactly 3 were
      below, and also there were no decimals to complicate matters.
      Who is right?</p>

      <p>Zargo says that instead of doing lots of intricate
      calculations, he can find the area of a rhombus by just
      multiplying the diagonal lengths together. See if you can
      determine in a minute if his method is plausible.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you draw a line from the vertex of any triangle to the
      midpoint of the opposite side (i.e. the median), will it be
      perpendicular to that side, or would it bisect the vertex
      angle from which it was drawn?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A pollster interviewed 100 families, and reported that the
      mean number of children was 2.037 and the median was 1.8. I
      do not believe either of these figures. Do you? Why?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Brian thinks he remembers that the area of a parallelogram
      is equal to the product of consecutive sides, but he isn’t
      quite sure. You can’t remember whether he’s right either, but
      you know you can check his formula to see if it is plausible.
      Is it?</p>

      <p>Show that the formula for the area of a triangle can be

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Hero’s formula gives us a formula for the area of a
      triangle based only on the lengths of its 3 sides (see
      problem 7 in this lesson). No one has yet come up with a
      formula for the area of a quadrilateral based only on the
      lengths of its 4 sides. Why do you think that is?</p>

      STD. What does she notice about how their shapes compare to
      each other?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Grunchik changes the viewing window
      on his calculator so that it graphs $x$ values from -4 to 4,
      and $y$ values from -10 to 20. He then graphs the same three

      their shapes compare to each other?</p>

      <p>Bart is feeling a little sick. Having recently read about
      simpsonitis, a very rare and debilitating disease, and being
      somewhat hypochondriacal, he goes to see his physician, Dr.
      Kalvakian. The doctor checks him out and decides to
      administer a special blood test for detecting the
        disease.</p>
      
      <p>This diagnostic test is 98% accurate (returns a positive
      result) for people who have simpsonitis and 95% accurate
      (returns a negative result) for people who do not have
      simpsonitis. Approximately 0.3% of people in the country
        actually have this disease.</p>
      
      <p>Unfortunately, several days after taking the blood test, Bart
      receives a phone call from Dr. Kalvakian. The doctor tells
      him that he tested positive for the disease. Bart asks,
      “What’s the chance that I actually have simpsonitis? I mean,
      you said that the test was not 100% accurate.” Dr. Kalvakian
      replies, “Well, there’s a 98% chance that you have the
        disease, Bart.”</p>
      
      <p>Bart initially has a cow, but then he decides to tell the
      brainy Lisa what Dr. Kalvakian said. What do you suppose Lisa
