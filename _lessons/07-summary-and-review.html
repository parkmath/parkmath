      an angle that — if you did try to find its tangent on your

      function with angles on the x-axis and sines on the y-axis,
      how far would you have to go on the x-axis before the graph
      started to repeat itself?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If you made a graph of the cosine
      function with angles on the x-axis and cosines on the y-axis,
      between which angles would the graph be below the x-axis?</p>
