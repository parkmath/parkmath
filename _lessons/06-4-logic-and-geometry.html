    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Lewis Carroll, of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> fame, made the
    following set of statements in his less famous book, <em>Symbolic
      Logic</em>.”</p>

    <p>No potatoes of mine, that are new, have been boiled.
    All my potatoes in this dish are fit to eat.
    No unboiled potatoes of mine are fit to eat.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What, if anything, can you conclude from these three
      statements?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>It’s a well-known fact that all squares are rectangles, but
    not all rectangles are squares. We can express these statements
    in the form below.</p>

    <div style="margin: 3em;"><p>If a figure is a square, then it is a rectangle. (true)<br>
      If a figure is a rectangle, then it is a square. (false)</p></div>

    <p>You may recall that these statements are called <em class="vocab">converses</em> of
    each other, as is true of any pair of statements of the
    form</p>

    <div style="margin: 3em;"><p>If $A$ then $B$.<br>
      If $B$ then $A$.</p></div>

    <p>You may have seen Venn diagrams at some point in your life.
    They are handy when thinking about logic. For instance, the
    statement “All business people are savvy” (or “If a person is a
    businessman, then he is savvy”) can be represented by the
    following diagram:</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-4-logic-and-geometry/logic%20diagrams.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>In this example, Algernon is a savvy businessman, Aberforce
    is savvy but not a businessman, and Aloysius is neither savvy
    nor a businessman.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw a similar diagram illustrating the statement “All
      savvy people are businessmen.”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you write the statement
      in “if/then” form?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Do the diagrams make it clear that
      the statements “All businessmen are savvy” and “All savvy
      people are businessmen” mean different things?</p>
    </div>

    <p>You’ve seen that if/then statements have converses, and that
    just because the if/then statement is true doesn’t necessarily
    mean the converse is. Here are two other types of statements
    you can get from an if/then statement.</p>

    <p>Take the statement “if $A$ then $B$”.<br>
      “If not-$A$ then not-$B$” is called the <em class="vocab">inverse</em>.<br>
      “If not-$B$ then not-$A$” is called the <em class="vocab">contrapositive</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Pick three “test” statements of the form “if $A$ then $B$.”
      Then use them to decide if the inverse and/or the
      contrapositive must be true when the original statement is.
      If you’re not sure, try drawing Venn diagrams.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Some statements on your list of theorems and postulates can
    be written in if/then form as well, and it is worth
    investigating if their converses are true. For example, you
    probably have the following statement:</p>

    <p>Opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write a pair of if/then statements expressing this
      statement and its converse.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you were going to prove the converse, what would be the
      given? What would be the result that you are trying to
      prove?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Go ahead and prove the statement “if a quadrilateral has
      both pairs of opposite sides congruent, then it is a
      parallelogram.” (Hint: this is a problem where adding
      something extra to the diagram is useful.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Another way of saying what you just proved is that having
      both pairs of opposite sides congruent is <em class="vocab">sufficient</em> for a
    quadrilateral to be a parallelogram. In other words, if you
    have a quadrilateral and you know its opposite sides are
    congruent, that’s enough — you don’t need to know anything else
    about it to know that it’s a parallelogram.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the original statement on your list,
    “Opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent,” provides a
    statement that is true about all parallelograms. This kind of
      statement is called a <em class="vocab">necessary</em> condition. For if you’ve got
    a quadrilateral without congruent opposite sides, you know you
    definitely don’t have a parallelogram. You’re lacking one of
    the necessary criteria.</p>

    <p>Conditions aren’t always both necessary and sufficient. For
    example, having four right angles is necessary for a
    quadrilateral to be a square, but having four right angles is
    not sufficient for a quadrilateral to be a square. The
    quadrilateral might be only a rectangle and still have four
    right angles.</p>

    <p>Also, conditions can be sufficient without being necessary.
    For example, a closed shape’s having three 60-degree angles is
    sufficient for the shape to be a triangle, but it is certainly
    not necessary that a triangle have three 60-degree angles.</p>

    <p>What’s more, necessary and sufficient conditions don’t have
    to be about shapes. For example, at Park, playing soccer for
    all four years is sufficient to fill your athletic requirement.
    Also, being a senior is necessary for taking Senior Studio —
    you can’t take Senior Studio without being a senior.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is having four congruent sides necessary, sufficient, or
      both for being a square?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is having four congruent sides necessary, sufficient, or
      both for being a rhombus?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is playing soccer all four years a necessary condition for
      Park students to satisfy their athletic requirement? Is being
      a senior at Park sufficient for taking Senior Studio?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

      According to him, is being a wise child sufficient for being

      <p>Euclid’s fifth postulate is famous for being more

        interior angles are not equal, then the lines will meet.</em></p>

      <p>Euclid also proved a theorem which states</p>

    <p>Many arguments have this type of structure:</p>

    <ul class="bulleted">
    <li>If a Park Student is in fall semester
    of 10th grade, then they are taking a “Writing about…”
    class.</li>

    <li> Gwendolyn is in fall semester of
    10th grade.</li>

    <li>Therefore, Gwendolyn is taking a “Writing about”
    class.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Aristotle, a Greek philosopher who lived close
      to the time of Euclid, called this a <em class="vocab">syllogism</em>.
    A syllogism has the form</p>
  
	<ul class="bulleted">
  
    <li>If $A$ then $B$</li>

    <li>$A$</li>

    <li>Therefore, $B$.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this example, the statements “if $A$ then $B$” and “$A$” are
      called <em class="vocab">premises</em> and “therefore, $B$” is called the <em class="vocab">conclusion</em>.
    Note that if an argument really works, if you agree with the
    premises you should also agree with the conclusion. (And if you
    don’t, that’s a sign that something is wrong with the
    argument!)</p>

    <p>Another form of argument can lead you to form an “if/then”
    statement as the conclusion. For example,</p>

    <ul class="bulleted">
    <li> If a Park Student is in fall semester
    of 10th grade, then they are taking a
    “Writing about…” class.</li>

    <li>If a student is taking a “Writing about” class, then they
    have to write a self-reflection.</li>

    <li>Therefore, if a Park student is in fall semester of 10th
    grade, then they have to write a self-reflection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This type of argument has the form</p>

    
    <ul class="bulleted">
    <li>If $A$ then $B$</li>

    <li>If $B$ then $C$</li>

    <li>Therefore, if $A$ then $C$.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note the important thing that allows you to
    conclude the final step is that “B” occurs as the “then” clause
    of the first statement and the “if” clause of the second
    statement.</p>

    <p>Boiling arguments down to their logical structure can be
    handy, especially when you start using the equivalence of the
    contrapositive. For example, recall the Lewis Carroll puzzle of
    problem #18:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>a) All babies are illogical.</li>

    <li>b) Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile.</li>

    <li>c) Illogical persons are despised.</li>
            </ul>

    <p>Suppose you have managed to rewrite the puzzle this way:</p>

    <p>(from a and c) If you are a baby, then you are
    despised</p>

    <p>(from b) If you can manage a crocodile, then you are not
    despised.</p>
      


    <p>Right now the premises are written as</p>

    <p>If $A$ then $B$.</p>

    <p>If $C$ then not-$B$.</p>

    <p>It’s difficult to know what we can conclude just now, but if
    we replace the second premise with its contrapositive, “if $B$
    then not-$C$,” we can make things match up in the right
    way:</p>

    <ul style="bulleted">
    <li>If you are a baby, then you are
    despised.</li>

    <li>If you are despised, then you cannot manage a
    crocodile.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This allows us to easily see that we can conclude</p>

    <ul style="bulleted">
    <p>If you are a baby, then you cannot manage a crocodile.</p>
    </ul>
    
    <p>…which is the solution to the puzzle.</p>

    <p>For exercises 38-41 and 43-46, say what, if anything, you

    <p class="Problems---Problem-flow">Given: $\overline {CD} \cong \overline {AB} $, $\angle A
    \cong \angle C$.<br>
      Prove: $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.</p>

    <p class="Problems---Problem-flow">Draw perpendiculars from points B and D that intersect the
    opposite sides of the quadrilateral at E and F, respectively.
    Then $\Delta DCF \cong \Delta BAE$ by AAS. Since the
    triangles are congruent, $\overline {AE} \cong \overline {CF}
      $.</p>

    <p class="Problems---Problem-flow">Also, from the triangle congruency we know $\overline {BE}
    \cong \overline {FD} $ as well. This means that we can now
    show $\Delta DEB \cong \Delta BFD$ by Hypotenuse-Leg. From
      this, we can conclude $\overline {DE} \cong \overline {FB} $.</p>

    <p class="Problems---Problem-flow">Now, the lengths of $\overline {DE} $ and $\overline {EA} $ add up to the length of $\overline {DA} $, and likewise the
    lengths of $\overline {BF} $ and $\overline {FC} $ add up
    to the length of $\overline {BC} $. Since $\overline {DA}
    $ and $\overline {BC} $ are made up of the same-sized
    “pieces”, they must themselves be congruent. Therefore, $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.</p>
