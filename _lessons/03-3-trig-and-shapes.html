    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>So far, the trigonometry that you’ve learned applies
    specifically to right triangles. Even with shapes you see
    around you that don’t look like right triangles, with a little
    creativity you can still analyze these shapes using right
    triangles.</p>

    <p>An “octastar” is a perfectly regular eight-pointed star.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find two different ways to split up the octastar into
      right triangles.</p>

      </figure>

    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here’s a regular pentagon with each side measuring 2
      inches.</p>
      <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure3.png" >
      </figure>
      <p class="problem-part">Find the measure of each angle of the
      pentagon by first drawing a circle around the pentagon. (You
      might want to use the center of the circle.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Let’s split this pentagon into six
      right triangles. (You can assume that the lines that look
      vertical and horizontal are vertical and horizontal.) Fill in
      all the angles that you can figure out in the new diagram.</p>
      
      <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure4.png" >
      </figure>

      <p class="problem-part">Now that you have all the angles,
      what more do you need to find in order to calculate the area of
      the pentagon? (Saying what you need to find is enough… you
      don’t need to actually calculate the area.)</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>In the diagrams so far, every drawing has been split up by
    turning it into a collection of right triangles pieced together
    – in other words, you add up the triangles to get the picture
    you want. Here’s a slightly different way to use that strategy.
    Suppose you’re investigating the following triangle:</p>

    <figure class="fig-25">
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure5.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>You could split it into two right triangles by adding the
    following line:</p>

    <figure class="fig-25">
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure6.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>But suppose for some reason you didn’t want to split up the
    long side of the triangle. Instead, you might notice that if
    you add a small right triangle on to your diagram, you get a
    big right triangle:</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure7.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>One strategy to think about when you <em class="vocab">visualize</em> a problem is
    that you can alter the diagram to see it in a new way. Finding
    a new way to see a picture, or figuring out an interesting way
    to split a diagram into pieces, can give you insight into the
    problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the diagram below a circle is fitted exactly into a
      square. The center of the circle is O and the length of
      diameter AB is 3.5 cm. What is the area of the square?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Split each of these three identical triangles into two
      right triangles, each in a different way.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The line segments you used to split the triangles in
      problem 5 are called altitudes.</p>

    For the rest of this lesson, your numerical answers should
    either be exact or have 2-decimal place accuracy, unless you
    are asked to estimate an answer.</p>

    <h3>Inverse Trigonometry</h3>

    <p>So far, given the right information, you have been able to
    find the length of sides of a triangle, and might well wonder
    if there might be a way to find the angles when the appropriate
    information has been given. For example, could you find the
    angle at the top of the right triangle below? You could take a
    guess, check your result, and refine your guess.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/image017.png" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make a guess. Think about how you could test your guess
      for accuracy, given what you know about sines (or cosines).
      Test it and adjust your guess until you get the correct
      answer to the nearest degree.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are ways to figure out the trigonometry of every angle
    exactly, but when you type “sin 67”, for example, into your
    calculator, it is basically looking the answer up on a table:
    sin 67° is about .9205.</p>

    <p>Now suppose you know that an angle has a sine of .9205, but
    you don’t remember the degree measure of the angle. You can try
    to figure out the angle, as you did in problem 10 above, using
    reasoning. Or, you can use your calculator to look at the sine
    table, backwards – this is like asking “The sine of what angle
    would give me .9205?”</p>

    <p>To do this, first make sure your calculator is set in degree
    mode. Then, type
    “$\sin^{-1}\;.9205$” into your calculator, it will give you an
    angle whose sine is .9205. Indeed you will get an answer of
    about 66.999°. (Notice that the answer we got is a tiny bit
    different from the angle we started with – this is because
    .9205 is rounded.) Your calculator has “$\cos^{-1}$” and “$\tan^{-1}$”
    buttons as well.</p>

    <h3>Angles of Descent and Elevation</h3>

    <p>In real-world problems, angles are often measured relative to the
    ground, or to the horizontal.</p>

    (Note that since the sun is extremely far away, all the light rays are
    essentially parallel). So, around noon, the angle of the sun is close to
    90° and you have a very short shadow:</p>
