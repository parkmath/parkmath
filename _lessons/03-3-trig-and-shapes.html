<h1>Lesson 3:</h1><h1>Trigonometry and Shapes</h1>
  <section class="development">




    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>So far, the trigonometry that you’ve learned applies
    specifically to right triangles. Even with shapes you see
    around you that don’t look like right triangles, with a little
    creativity you can still analyze these shapes using right
    triangles.</p>

    <p>An “octastar” is a perfectly regular eight-pointed star.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>Find two different ways to split up the octastar into
      right triangles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>Here’s a regular pentagon with each side measuring 2
      inches.</p>
    </div>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure3.png" >
    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">. Find the measure of each angle of the
    pentagon by first drawing a circle around the pentagon. (You
    might want to use the center of the circle.)</p>

    <p class="problem-part">. Let’s split this pentagon into six
    right triangles. (You can assume that the lines that look
    vertical and horizontal are vertical and horizontal.) Fill in
    all the angles that you can figure out in the new diagram.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure4.png" >
    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">. Now that you have all the angles,
    what more do you need to find in order to calculate the area of
    the pentagon? (Saying what you need to find is enough… you
    don’t need to actually calculate the area.)</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>In the diagrams so far, every drawing has been split up by
    turning it into a collection of right triangles pieced together
    – in other words, you add up the triangles to get the picture
    you want. Here’s a slightly different way to use that strategy.
    Suppose you’re investigating the following triangle:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure5.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>You could split it into two right triangles by adding the
    following line:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure6.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>But suppose for some reason you didn’t want to split up the
    long side of the triangle. Instead, you might notice that if
    you add a small right triangle on to your diagram, you get a
    big right triangle:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure7.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>One strategy to think about when you visualize a problem is
    that you can alter the diagram to see it in a new way. Finding
    a new way to see a picture, or figuring out an interesting way
    to split a diagram into pieces, can give you insight into the
    problem.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>In the diagram below a circle is fitted exactly into a
      square. The center of the circle is O and the length of
      diameter AB is 3.5 cm. What is the area of the square?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>Find the area of this shape:</p>
    </div>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/image011.png" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>Split each of these three identical triangles into two
      right triangles, each in a different way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>The line segments you used to split the triangles in
      problem 5 are called altitudes.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Why do you think they are so named?
      Write a clear definition of an altitude.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Draw altitudes for the three
      identical triangles below, each
      in a different way.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
    For the rest of this lesson, your numerical answers should
    either be exact or have 2-decimal place accuracy, unless you
    are asked to estimate an answer.</p>

    </figure>

    <p class="Lesson---Subheading">Inverse Trigonometry</p>

    <p>So far, given the right information, you have been able to
    find the length of sides of a triangle, and might well wonder
    if there might be a way to find the angles when the appropriate
    information has been given. For example, could you find the
    angle at the top of the right triangle below? You could take a
    guess, check your result, and refine your guess.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/image017.png" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>Make a guess. Think about how you could test your guess
      for accuracy, given what you know about sines (or cosines).
      Test it and adjust your guess until you get the correct
      answer to the nearest degree.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are ways to figure out the trigonometry of every angle
    exactly, but when you type “sin 67”, for example, into your
    calculator, it is basically looking the answer up on a table:
    sin 67° is about .9205.</p>

    <p>Now suppose you know that an angle has a sine of .9205, but
    you don’t remember the degree measure of the angle. You can try
    to figure out the angle, as you did in problem 10 above, using
    reasoning. Or, you can use your calculator to look at the sine
    table, backwards – this is like asking “The sine of what angle
    would give me .9205?”</p>

    <p>To do this, first make sure your calculator is set in degree
    mode. Then, type
    “sin$-1$&nbsp;.9205” into your calculator, it will give you an
    angle whose sine is .9205. Indeed you will get an answer of
    about 66.999°. (Notice that the answer we got is a tiny bit
    different from the angle we started with – this is because
    .9205 is rounded.) Your calculator has “cos$-1$” and “tan$-1$”
    buttons as well.</p>

    <p class="Lesson---Subheading">Angles of Descent and
    Elevation</p>

    <p>In real-world problems, angles are often measured relative
    to the ground, or to the horizontal.</p>

    <p>In this diagram, the plane is taking off at an angle of
    elevation of 15°.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/image045.png" >

    <p>In this diagram, the plane is landing with an angle of
    descent of 25°. Another name for this angle is the angle of
    depression.</p>

    <p>In problems 20 through 22, let’s define angle of the sun to

    rays are essentially parallel). So, around noon, the angle of
    the sun is close to 90° and you have a very short shadow:</p>

      until it’s above Druid Hill Park, which is halfway between
      Timonium and BWI. Then the plane changes its angle of descent
