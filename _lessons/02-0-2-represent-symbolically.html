        The diagram below shows a rectangle (not a square) that
        has been cut into 9 squares, no two being the same size. The
        smallest square is 3 cm by 3 cm. Find the sizes of the other
        squares.
        </p>

    <p>In trying to solve problem 1, some of you might have first
    tried a little tinkering.
    The diagram does suggest that a side of the second smallest
    square might be somewhere between 6 and 9, and so you might
    have tried some or all of the
    integers 6 through 9. As it turns out, not only do none of
    these integers work, but after trying any one of the numbers it
    might not be at all clear to you
    whether it would be too high or too low. So refining the
    process to get at the answer might prove to be a bit
    challenging.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, some of you algebra lovers might have
    bypassed that
    wonderful play and jumped right into some symbolic
    representation of the length of the side. If you haven’t
    already done so, give algebra a try.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="problems">

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Representing the length of a side of the second smallest
      square (or some other square) by $x$:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Work around the diagram, and find
      an expression involving $x$ for the length of the left side
      of the rectangle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find an expression involving $x$,
      different from that in part a, for the length of the right
      side of the rectangle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">By equating the expressions in
      parts a and b, solve the resulting equation for $x$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now find the sizes of all the
      squares.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Even though you might have been able to discover the answer
    by tinkering, you might also agree that the algebra approach
    was somewhat more efficient, despite the fact that it was
    certainly not a walk in the park and required a great deal of
    care and manipulation. Further, the algebra not only provided a
    solution that you could be sure of, but also provides a way for
    you to communicate your solution in a clear and convincing
    manner.</p>

    <p>Of course algebra is not a panacea. It is not the best
    approach for all such problems, and even when it is the best
    approach one still has to make decisions about which of the
    unknown properties should be replaced by variables. And even
    after you have made these decisions, you may realize that the
    equation you have written requires very difficult algebra to
    solve, so much so that you need to learn new skills to have any
    hope of solving it.</p>

    <p>In addition to its efficiency, security and its ability to
    communicate succinctly and cogently, an algebraic approach can
    provide you with a deeper understanding of the problem. In
    problem 2, for example, you might have been able to discover
    the relationship between the size of the smallest square and
    the sizes of the other squares, allowing you to see the
    solution for a starting square of any size. Using algebra can
    also allow you to investigate the possibility of multiple
    correct answers, something that a more tinkering approach is
    less likely to reveal.</p>

    <p>Take a look at another problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What happens when you take four consecutive numbers, add
      them all up, add 10, and divide your answer by 4? Try it four
      or five times to test your observation.</p>
    </div>

    <p>But can you be really sure that what you think happens in
    problem 3 always happens no matter what four numbers your start
    out with? You can of course produce a complicated verbal
    argument but an algebraic argument would be far more
    convincing.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Prove the result in problem 3.</p>

      <p>The Climate Change Committee at Park (CCCP) is trying to

      already collected is equal to $\tfrac{2}{3}$ of the amount still needed.
      How much has the CCCP already collected?</p>

      <p>Try this coin trick out on your friends. Get \$2.85 in
      change, and keep it in your pocket. Now, find a friend who’s
      got some change in her pocket. Have your friend hold the
      change from her pocket. For effect, you can have her jingle
      the change, and pretend you’re listening really carefully.
      Then, tell your friend: “I can tell, just by listening, how
      your amount of change compares to my amount. I think that <em>I</em>
      have exactly what you have... plus fifty cents... and then
      enough left over to make <em>your</em> change equal \$2.35.”</p>

      <p>As long as you have more change than your friend, this trick
      will ALWAYS work! Why?</p>

      <p>(From braingle.com) A magical dragon has three heads and
