    <h2>Introduction:
    From the Discrete
    to the Continuous</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The town of Tinyville has been growing at a steady rate
      for many years now. Its population at the end of the last
      three years is indicated in the table below. The population
      has been growing geometrically.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What will Tinyville’s population be
    at the end of 2007? at the end of 2008? n years after 2006?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What will Tinyville’s population be
    4.3 years after the end
    of 2006?</p>
      
    </div>

    <p>Your answer to Problem 1 Part b is based on an assumption —
    that is, that the formula for describing Tinyville’s population
    isn’t restricted to inputting whole numbers. In other words, it
    seems perfectly natural to assume that Tinyville’s population
    doesn’t wait until the end of the year to grow; population
    change is happening on a daily basis, if not hourly, every
    minute, or even every second. Had you been asked in the lesson
    on geometric sequences to graph the function you wrote in
    Problem 1 Part a, the graph would have looked like the graph
    shown in Figure 1.</p>

    <p>
  <figure class="fig-50 two-up">
    <img src="../images/08-2-modeling-with-exponential-functions/10-4-2%20Figure%201%20-%20REVISED%20O.tif.jpg" >
    <figcaption>Figure 1</figcaption>
    <img src="../images/08-2-modeling-with-exponential-functions/10-4-2%20Figure%202%20REVISED%20Oct.tif.jpg" >
    <figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
  </figure>
 </p>

    <p>The dots are not connected because $t$ can only take on whole
    number values. Notice that the ordered pair $\left(
    {4.3,281839} \right)$ is not a point on this graph. The graph
    in Figure 2 was created by assuming that t can take on
    non-integer values, such as 4.3, 1.67, or 7.3065. It is
    reasonable to assume that this graph is a more accurate
    depiction of how Tinyville’s population is growing. Both of the
    graphs show solutions to an exponential function, but it is the
    latter graph — the one in Figure 2 — that we will be studying
    at this point.</p>



    <p>To help us transition from the discrete aspect of the
    geometric sequence graphed in Figure 1 to the continuous aspect
    of the function graphed in Figure 2, we will introduce some
    notation. The equation for the first figure could be ${P_n} =
    232760{\left( {1.0455} \right)^n}$, where $n \ge 0$.
    Unfortunately, this kind of subscripting doesn’t allow for
    ${P_{4.3}}$: there is no such thing as the 4.3rd term of the
    sequence. We can get around this difficulty by replacing the
    ${P_n}$ with $P\left( n \right)$ and writing the equation
    as $P\left( n \right) = 232760{\left( {1.0455} \right)^n}$.
    Just as with Twist(x,y) or Oblongness(a,b), you don’t multiply
    P by n. We read this equation as “P of n equals…” $P\left( 2
    \right)$ is the population two years after 2006 (i.e.,
    $232760{\left( {1.0455} \right)^2} \approx 254423$), and
    $P\left( {4.3} \right)$ is the population 4.3 years after 2006
    (i.e., $232760{\left( {1.0455} \right)^{4.3}} \approx 281839$). This notation is called <em class="vocab">function notation</em> or <em class="vocab">Euler notation.</em></p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Calculate $P\left( {6.3} \right)$ and explain the meaning
      of this number in the context of the problem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If $f\left( x \right) = 5{x^2}$ and $g\left( t \right) = 3
      \cdot {2^t}$, then calculate each of the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$f\left( 2 \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$g\left( 2 \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$f\left( { - 1} \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <p>An <em class="vocab">exponential function</em> is any function that can be
    written in the form $f\left( x \right) = a \cdot {b^x}$, where
    $a &gt; 0,{\rm{ }}b &gt; 0,$ and $b \ne 1$. We will take a
    look at these
    restrictions on $a$ and $b$ shortly, but first let’s explore a
    couple more problems.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Look back at the work you did in Problem 1. When will
      the population of Tinyville reach 500,000? Use your
      calculator to help you answer this questions with 3-decimal
      place accuracy — i.e., correctly rounded to three digits
      after the decimal point.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>By what percentage does Tinyville’s population grow from
      year to year? This number is often called the <em class="vocab">annual
        percentage growth rate</em>. Where does this number show
      up in your expression describing Tinyville’s population
      $t$ years after 2006?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Tinyville’s rival town is Punyville. Punyville’s
      population at the end of 2004 had reached 375,000 but was now
      starting to decline geometrically. Its population at the end
      of each of the past three years is shown in the table
      below.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Not too far from Tinyville and Punyville is the town of
      Smallville. Smallville’s population grew rapidly and
      reached 610,000 by the end of 2006. Unfortunately, this rapid
      growth has now precipitated a rapid decline in the population
      due to overcrowding. The rate of decline is
      13% per year.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">On the axes you drew for Problem 6
      Part c, sketch a graph of Smallville’s population over the

      about them? How can you account for this similarity?</p>

      decay rate had been 10% rather than 13%. Without using your
      calculator, sketch Smallville’s population over time on the

      <p>Jill’s car is 10 years old and given that it has

    <p>In Problems 26-31, you will need to pay close
    attention to what information you’re being given and what
    question you’re trying to solve. With
    exponential growth and decay problems, the fact that something
    is decaying by 3% monthly doesn’t mean that the base of the
    exponential function
    is 3, .03, or even -.03. Often, the natural way of expressing a
    problem doesn’t translate directly
    into symbolic expressions, so read each problem carefully,
    pondering the meaning of each term
    and number that is presented, before venturing
    into answering the question posed. In doing this, you will be
