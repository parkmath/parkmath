    <p><q>O Bottom! Thou art translated!</q>
    <cite>–A Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite></p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Here is a picture of a ghost, whom you might recognize from
    the video game “Mac-Pan.” The ghost goes through the points
    $\left( {1,0} \right)$, $\left( {3,2} \right)$, and $\left(
    {4, - 1} \right)$.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/original Mac-Pan.png" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Those annoying ghosts will never stay put. This one moves
      three units to the right. What will be the new coordinates of
      the points on the ghost that are labeled in the picture?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Someone programming a computer game would have a hard time
    giving instructions like this: “If the ghost is at
    points$\left( {1,0} \right)$, $\left( {3,2} \right)$, and
    $\left( {4, - 1} \right)$ and needs to move three units to the
    right, the new coordinates will be…” If they programmed it that
    way, then if the ghost started in a different position they
    would have to change the instructions. Instead, the
    instructions would be more like “If a part of a ghost is at the
    point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ and the ghost moves three units to
    the right, that part will land on the point…”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You fill in the rest of the previous sentence. Make sure
      it works by trying it out on the points $\left( {1,0}
      \right)$, $\left( {3,2} \right)$, and $\left( {4, - 1}
      \right)$ and plotting them on a graph.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now think like a game designer and examine the more
      general problem. Ghosts can move up and down as well as right
      and left. Say the ghost’s right eye is at the point $\left(
      {x,y} \right)$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What will be the new coordinates of
      the eye if the ghost moves 5 units to the left?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What if the ghost moves 4 up?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What if 2 down?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What if 3 to the right AND 4
      up?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about 1 to the left AND 6
      down?</p>
    </div>

    <p>These movements that the ghost makes are called
    <em class="vocab">translations</em>. A translation of a shape changes its position,
    but doesn’t change anything else about the shape, like the size
    or the angles. A translation also doesn’t change which way the
    shape is pointing.</p>

    <p>Sometimes a game designer would like to change the way an
    object is pointing, though. For instance, in the figure below
    Mr. Mac-Pan is moving to the right, but if he changed direction
    so that he was moving upwards it might look more realistic if
    his mouth pointed up instead of to the right. This kind of
    change in an object is called a <em class="vocab">rotation</em>.</p>
    
    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/9-2-6 diagram 3.tif.jpg">
    </figure>

    <p>It’s natural to ask where a point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ would wind up after a certain rotation. The answer might not be
    obvious, but we can make this question easier for
    ourselves by thinking about a specific example first.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Rotate Mr. Mac-Pan 90 degrees counterclockwise around the
      point $\left( {0,0} \right)$. Think of this as “spinning”
      him, as you would a spinner in a board game — with your
      finger holding him down on $\left( {0,0} \right)$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does the top of his head
      (previously at $\left( {0,2} \right)$) land?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does his bottom jaw
      (previously at $\left( {1.5, - 1} \right)$) land?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does his “middle” (previously
      at $\left( {0,0} \right)$) land?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The rotation you did in the previous problem is called a
      <em class="vocab">90-degree rotation with center $\left( {0,0} \right)$.</em>
    When not specified, it’s assumed the rotation is
    counterclockwise.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Based on your results in the previous problem, say where a
      point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ lands after a 90-degree rotation
      with center $\left( {0,0} \right)$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Trying specific numbers when you’re asked to solve a more
    general question is an example of tinkering. When you’re asked
    to come up with a formula, you can tinker by generating data
    for yourself. Use tinkering copiously in this lesson.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Where would each of the three specified points (in problem
      4) on Mac-Pan land if you instead did a rotation of 180
      degrees? How about 270 degrees?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Tinker: Make up some other simple shapes that contain the
      point $\left( {0,0} \right)$, and rotate them 90, 180, and
      270 degrees counterclockwise around the origin. Conjecture
      two more formulas describing where a point $\left( {x,y}
      \right)$ will end up — one for the 180-degree and one for the
      270-degree rotation. If necessary, cut out each shape and
      physically spin it.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In problem 4, you rotated Mr. Mac-Pan 90 degrees with center
    $(0,0)$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the same method as problem 4 — and cutting out a
      model if necessary — rotate Mr. Mac-Pan 90 degrees with
      center (0,2).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does the top of his head
      (previously at $\left( {0,2} \right)$) land?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does his bottom jaw
      (previously at $\left( {1.5, - 1} \right)$) land?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does his “middle” (previously
      at $\left( {0,0} \right)$) land?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Another way we could transform an object is through a
    reflection. Let’s start simply by considering this
    triangle.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/reflection triangle after problem 8.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>We’re going to draw the mirror image of this triangle,
    acting as if the $x$-axis were a mirror. Draw the new vertices
    and label them ${\rm{A'}}$, ${\rm{B'}}$, and ${\rm{C'}}$ to
    show that they correspond to the points A, B, and C, just as
    the top of the ghost’s head after a translation corresponds to
    the top of the head before. Then fill in the rest of the
    triangle. This is called a reflection over the $x$-axis.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose you wanted to reflect a ghost over the $x$-axis. If
      a point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ were on the ghost, where would
      it fall?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What would be the new coordinates of a point $\left( {x,y}
      \right)$ if it were instead reflected over the $y$-axis?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Another well-known feature of Mac-Pan: when a ghost eats
    Fattening Fungi, she grows twice as tall and twice as wide.</p>

    <p>This ghost is in a corner — a floor and wall formed by the
    $x$- and $y$-axes. When she expands, her “feet” need to stay on the
    floor, and she can’t expand past the wall, either, as she’s not
    your usual ghost. Here’s the ghost:</p>






<figure>
  <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/dilation ghost after problem 10.png">
</figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw in the new ghost, if she still expands to twice her
      length and width but can’t move through the wall or
      floor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Where does the top of her head go?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Where do her leftmost and rightmost bottom corners go?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Are there any points on or in the ghost that wouldn’t
      move?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If a point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ is on this ghost, where
      does it go?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Try out your conjecture from the last question. If the
      ghost’s eyes are at $(\frac{3}{2},\frac{5}{2})$ and$(\frac{5}{2}, \frac{5}{2})$ , use your formula to predict where
      they’ll go after the ghost eats the fungus. Does that look
      right in the picture?</p>
    </div>

    <p>This type of change in shape is called a dilation. In this
    case, it is a dilation of magnitude 2, or a dilation by a
    factor of 2. And, as with a rotation, the point that doesn’t
    move is called the center. Even though it is not in the center
    of the ghost, the point $\left( {0,0} \right)$ is the center of
    this dilation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now suppose that the ghost below can’t move past the
      ceiling at the line $y = 4$, but she can move past the $x$-
      and $y$-axes now. If she still expands to twice her length and
      width, draw in the new, dilated ghost.</p>
      
      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/problem 17.png">
      </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Which point in problem 17 stays the same before and after the dilation?
      What special name does this point have?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Looking again at Problem 11,</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the distance from the point
      $\left( {1,1} \right)$ on the original ghost to the center of
      the dilation?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the distance from the image
      of the point $\left( {1,1} \right)$— the place where that part of the ghost lands after the
      dilation — to the center of the dilation?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Looking at Problem 17,</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the distance from the point
      $\left( {1,1} \right)$ on the original ghost to the center of
      the dilation?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the distance from the image
      of $\left( {1,1} \right)$ to the center of the dilation?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The observations in the previous problem suggest another way
    to do dilations, without using coordinates. First, we’ll start
    with a point not on a grid, and a
    triangle to dilate. Our goal is to make the triangle twice as
    big.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/dilation after problem 20.png" >
    </figure>


<p></p>

<p>    Now we’ll make each point on the triangle twice as far away
    from the center headed in the same direction away. Here’s what
    that looks like for one of the points on the triangle:</p>
    
  <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/image%20of%20A%20after%20dilation.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p><em class="vocab">Copy the diagram above into your notebook</em>, and then find
      the images of the other vertices of the figure. You’ll need
      to use a ruler to find twice the length.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This, of course, was a dilation of magnitude 2, since all
    the lengths were
    doubled.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make another copy of the diagram preceding problem 21.
      Then draw the image under a dilation of magnitude 3.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the same diagram as in Problem 22, draw the image
      under a dilation of magnitude
      $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You can think of the lines you’ve drawn in to help draw
      each image as “guide lines.” Use the guide lines to draw
      in a few more images of the triangle under dilations or
      contractions, even though you may not be sure what the scale
      factor is. What do you have to pay attention to in
      order to make sure your triangle stays the right shape?</p>
    </div>

    <p>One more bit of vocabulary: When you apply a transformation
    to a shape, the new figure is called the image of a shape under
    that transformation. This is kind of like calling what you see
    in the mirror your image — a shape that is where you’d be if
    you were reflected over the mirror.</p>

    <p>In this section, you have learned about four types of
    transformations:
    $$Translations move a shape without changing its
    orientation.

    Rotations spin a shape around a certain point.</p>

    <p>Reflections give the mirror image of a shape on the other side
    of a line</p>

<p>    Dilations$/$Contractions stretch a shape away from a point or
    shrink a shape toward a point, keeping the same proportions as
    before.</p>

    <p>Often, you know more than you think you know. Problems 49-51
    ask you to find formulas for some complicated transformations.
    You can make them more manageable by first simplifying the
    problem — asking yourself the same question using numbers for
    the point instead of $(a,b)$ or $(x,y)$. In some ways, this is
    the opposite of representing symbolically — you’re moving from
    general symbols to specific examples. As always, if you’re
    having trouble figuring out where a point would go, don’t
    forget to draw a picture.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Describe where the point $\left( {a,b} \right)$ ends up if
      a shape that contains it is reflected over the $x$-axis, then
      the result is reflected over the $y$-axis, and then reflected
      over the $x$-axis again.</p>

    <p>Simplifying the problem is particularly useful when asked to
    come up with a conjecture: a statement which you believe always
    to be true. The following questions ask you to do that.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The square $\left( {1,0} \right)$, $\left( {5,0} \right)$, $\left( {1,4} \right)$, $\left( {5,4} \right)$ gets

      becomes a rectangle twice as tall but with the same
      width.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Give the coordinates for the
      rectangle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Conjecture a formula that describes
      what happens to any point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ under this

      your formula with a shape that’s not sitting on the

      horizontally to be twice as wide but keep the same height.

      <p>Although you have studied rotations around the origin of

      would be equivalent to a rotation of 86 degrees.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Say you have an asymmetric figure.
      You repeatedly apply a 240° rotation
      to it. How many times do you need to apply the rotation
      before the

      in which it started?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Which angular rotations between 0
      and 360 degrees, after being repeatedly applied to a figure,
      will eventually result in the figure returning to its

      rotations that do NOT eventually result in the figure
      returning to its original

    <p>We still don’t have a formula that will allow you to figure
    out the image of a dilation centered at a point. The following
    few problems will help you derive it. Let’s start just by
    thinking about dilating any shape around the point $\left(
    {3,2} \right)$. Then we’ll start to use symbols, one piece at
    a time.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the $x$-direction, how far is the point $\left( {x,y}
      \right)$ from $\left( {3,2} \right)$? Your answer should be
      a signed distance — that is, if your point is to the right of
      $\left( {3,2} \right)$ the distance is positive and if your
      point is to the left of $\left( {3,2} \right)$ the distance
      is negative.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the $y$-direction, how far is $\left( {x,y} \right)$ from
      $\left( {3,2} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If is twice as far as $\left( {x,y} \right)$ from $\left(
      {3,2} \right)$, how far away is it in the $x$-direction? In
      the $y$-direction? Make sure your answer is in terms of $x$ and
      $y$, not $x'$ and $y'$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now write a formula that gives the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of
      in terms of the coordinates $x$ and $y$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Test your formula on some specific points. Make sure that
      they wind up twice as far away from $\left( {3,2} \right)$ after the dilation. If not, go back and change your answers
      to the previous questions until you find a formula that
      works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now adapt your formula so that it works not just for a
      dilation by a factor of 2, but a dilation by a factor of
      n.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Finally, adapt your formula so that it works not just for
      a dilation centered at $\left( {3,2} \right)$, but one
      centered at the point $\left( {h,k} \right)$.</p>
