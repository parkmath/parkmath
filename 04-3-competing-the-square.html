    <h1>Lesson 3:Completing
    the Square</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In Lesson 1 you investigated how to solve quadratic
    equations like $5\left( {x + 3} \right)\left( {x - 7} \right) =
    0$ or . You can use the Zero Product
    Property to solve the first equation, but you’ll need to factor
    (reverse distribution)
    the second equation before you can use that property to solve
    this equation.
    It’s really nice, in fact, when you can use factoring as a way
    of transforming an equation into another form that is easier to
    analyze. Unfortunately, you also saw a few equations that did
    not readily yield to factoring. Below are some equations of
    this type:</p>

    <p>$\begin{array}{c} {x^2} + 4x + 2 = 0,\\ {x^2} - 6x + 6 =
    0,{\rm{ and}}\\ {x^2} + 10x - 20 = 0. \end{array}$</p>

    <p>Notice that had these equations initially been derived from
    the equations shown below —</p>

    <p>$\begin{array}{c} y = {x^2} + 4x + 2\\ y = {x^2} - 6x +
    6,{\rm{ and}}\\ y = {x^2} + 10x - 20--- \end{array}$</p>

    <p>you would not be able to use factoring as a way of
    determining the exact values of the $x$-intercepts. You would
    be able to approximate them with your calculator but never get
    the exact values for them. You actually do know a way — a
    process — of solving this problem, however. Let’s take a look
    at a process that will get you the exact values.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>There are two values of $x$ that satisfy the equation
      ${x^2} = 9$ . What are they? These are called the solutions
      of the
      equation.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The two numbers you found in Problem 1 are each called a
    square root of 9.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>What are the solutions to ${x^2} = 49$ ? What are the
      square roots of 49?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>What are the solutions to ${x^2} = 50$ ? What are the
      square roots of 50?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If your answers to problem 3 were 7.071067812 and
    -7.071067812 (or shorter versions of one or both of these
    numbers) then you did not find the exact
    solutions. These numbers are approximations of the square roots
    of 50.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>Explain why \[{\rm{7.07106781}}{{\rm{2}}^{\rm{2}}}\] z
      cannot equal 50.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Given your answer to Problem 4, then, you may wonder why
    your calculator indicates that the square of 7.071067812 is 50.
    Your calculator does this because it cannot hold onto enough
    digits to show you what this squared number actually is. A more
    powerful calculator could show you that ${7.071067812^2} =
    50.000000001902467344$ . Pretty close to 50, but not quite!
    The fact is that there is no way to write down the exact value
    of the positive square root of 50 by using decimal
    notation.</p>

    <p>When we want to indicate the exact solutions to the equation
    ${x^2} = 50$ , or the exact square roots of 50, we just write
    $\sqrt {50} $ to indicate the positive square root of 50 and $
    - \sqrt {50} $ to indicate the negative square root of 50. Keep
    this in mind when you’re being asked to determine the exact
    solutions to an equation and you need to find square roots in
    order to do this.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>Find the exact solutions to each equation.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^2} = 16$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^2} - 20 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you weren’t sure what to do in Problem 5 Part c think
    about replacing the
    “$x - 2$ ” with $A$, solve for $A$, and then figure out what
    $x$ would be from there. Try Problem 5 Part c again if you
    didn’t correctly solve it the first time.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>Find the exact solution to each equation.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\left( {x + 3} \right)^2} =
      10$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\left( {x - 6} \right)^2} - 25 =
      0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\left( {x + 1} \right)^2} - 35 =
      0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${\left( {x - 10} \right)^2} + 45 =
      56$</p>
    </div>

    <p>At this point you should have a pretty good idea about how
    to solve quadratic equations that are in the form ${\left( {x -
    h} \right)^2} - k = 0$ . So, if you can take an equation
    like
    
    
    ${x^2} + 4x + 2 = 0$ r
    
    and rewrite it in the form
    
    
    ${\left( {x - h} \right)^2} - k = 0$</p>

    <p>Then you would be able to solve the original equation since
    you know how to solve an equation in this last form. So, let’s
    figure out how to get a quadratic equation of the form ${x^2} +
    bx + c = 0$ r into the form ${\left( {x - h} \right)^2} - k =
    0$ { .</p>

      <p>Look carefully at each equation in the right column of the

      equation in the left column of the table. Look at one row at
      a time and see if you can pick up on any patterns between the
      equation on the right and its partner on the left. Once you
      have come up with some patterns try to use one or more of
      them to rewrite the equation below so that it is in the form
      ${\left( {x - h} \right)^2} - k = 0$ } (Form V in the table
      above).
      
      ${x^2} + 8x + 1 = 0$ r .</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="9">
      <p>Once you have rewritten the equation in Problem 8 solve it

    </div>

    <p>The process of adding a constant to the terms \[{x^2} + bx +
    c\] so that the resulting expression can be factored as a
    perfect square is called completing the square. As you can see
    in Problems 8 and 9, completing the square can be used to solve
    quadratic equations that don’t appear to factor.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>Use completing the square to solve the following
      equations. Find exact solutions.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^2} - 20x - 100 = 0$</p>
    </div>

    <p>In Problem 10 the solutions you were finding are called the
    roots of the equation since each equation is in the form
    ${\rm{BLAH}} = 0$ . As you’ve seen before, these roots (these
    solutions) can be interpreted as $x$-intercepts of a
    corresponding quadratic function. For example, the roots of the
    equation are the $x$-intercepts of $y = {x^2} + 12x - 21$ . As
    it turns out, the values of $x$ that make $y$ equal to zero are
    called the zeros of the function. And, as you learned in
    $Quadratic Models and Algebra$, these zeros can be used to
    determine the exact coordinates of the vertex.</p>

      <p>Find the exact zeros of the following quadratic

      on your graph, the exact coordinates of the vertex, the
      $x$-intercepts, and the $y$-intercept.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You should pat yourself on the back after completing Problem
    13. You not only can fully analyze a linear function ($y = ax +
    b$ ): solve it, graph it, find its slope and intercepts without
    the calculator; you now have some ideas about how to fully
    analyze a quadratic function of the form $y = {x^2} + bx + c$ r
    . Later, we will get to analyzing the more general form , where
    $a$ can be any real number other than zero, and we will even
    look at what happens when there don’t appear to be any zeros
    (it turns out that there are zeros, but they are of a
    completely different nature).</p>

      <p>There are some equations that are “quadratic in form,”

      substitute into the equation, getting ${y^2} - 2y - 8 = 0$ r

    Let’s suppose $\sqrt { - 1} $ exists (and so does $ - \sqrt { -
    1} $ ). Now, complete the algebra you started in Part a and
    use these zeros to find the exact
